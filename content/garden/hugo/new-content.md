To create a new content file, simply run `hugo new <path> <options>` from the root directory. All of my content is in the `content` folder, so this file was created by `hugo new content/garden/hugo/new-content.md`.

Now, should content be segregated into different folders or not? Each folder directly under `content/` defines a new [Type]({{< relref "content-type" >}}). Does it make sense to create different content types for a digital garden? I'm not sure.
