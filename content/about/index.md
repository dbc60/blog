Good day! I'm Doug Cuthbertson, a professional software engineer living in Massachusetts. Mostly, I develop applications and kernel drivers on Microsoft Windows. Lately, I've been writing software in [Go](https://golang.org/) for both Linux and Windows (it's my new favorite programming language).
I tend to read too much about software development and not write enough code, so my intent is to use this blog to explore some of the aspects of coding and engineering I've enjoyed reading about and put them into practice. Some of the subjects I intend to explore are basic things like organizing development environments for new projects, as well as using design patterns, algorithms and data structures I find interesting.

Besides my professional work, I'm a husband, a father to two really wonderful children who have grown up and are launching careers of their own in these very tough times.

Among other things, I

- dream about model railroads (it was a favorite hobby of mine and I hope to get back to it one day soon)
- take photographs, and occasionally sketch and draw.
- enjoy gardening and cooking with my wife, Adelle.

The banner is a picture I took on a trip to Rockport, MA. with my family several years ago. The building is commonly known as [Motif No. 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_Number_1). It's a replica of an old fishing shack built in 1840. The original was destroyed during the blizzard of 1978.

See my [Now](/now/) page for what I've been up to lately.
