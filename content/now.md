I am a member of the Agent Team at [Threat Stack, Inc](https://www.threatstack.com/) in Boston, Massachusetts. I am the primary developer for the Windows Agent, and I have been a significant contributor to the Linux, containerized, and Fargate agents. I am having a great time working there. My coworkers are very creative and a joy to work with.

I am also a frustrated game-designer wannabee. Game design looks like fun, but it is difficult to find the time to purue it.
