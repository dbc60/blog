I'm working for [Threat Stack, Inc](https://www.threatstack.com/). in Boston Massachusetts. I'm on the Windows Agent Team, and am having a great time working there. My coworkers are very creative and thoughtful when it comes to digital security.

This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [/now page movement](https://sivers.org/nowff). You can see [lots of sites](http://nownownow.com/) which have `/now` pages.
