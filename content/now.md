I am a member of the Agent Team at [Threat Stack, Inc](https://www.threatstack.com/) in Boston, Massachusetts. I am the primary developer for the Windows Agent, and am a significant contributor to the Linux, containerized, and Fargate agents. Threat Stack is a great place to work, where everyone is very creative and a joy to collaborate with.

I am also a frustrated game-designer wannabee. Game design looks like fun, but it is difficult to find time to pursue it.

This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [/now page movement](https://sivers.org/nowff). You can see [lots of sites](http://nownownow.com/) which have `/now` pages.
