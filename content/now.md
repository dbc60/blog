I'm working for [Threat Stack, Inc](https://www.threatstack.com/). in Boston Massachusetts. I'm on the Windows Agent Team, and am having a great time working there. My coworkers are very creative and thoughtful when it comes to digital security.

I also practice the art of Hawaiian Shaolin Kempo, think about creating a model railroad. I've moved on from [Jeyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for blogging and note taking. Jekyll wasn't well supported on Windows, and generated pages too slowly. I've been using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) for note taking for a couple of years. I figured it works for [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html), it should be okay for making web pages out of a bunch of note files.

Of late, I've moved on to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for blogging and maybe I'll rewrite my notes in Markdown. At work we started writing code in [Go](https://golang.org/), and so Hugo seemed like a good fit for making a blog and learning more Go. We'll see where it leads.

This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [/now page movement](https://sivers.org/nowff). You can see [lots of sites](http://nownownow.com/) which have `/now` pages.
