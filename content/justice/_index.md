This section is dedicated to sharing resources and highlighting voices related to social justice, with a foundational focus on racial justice and the Black Lives Matter movement.

## Purpose

Although this blog is primarily technical, I want to set aside space for material that addresses issues of justice. This section aims to:

- **Amplify Black voices** – Highlight work by Black scholars, activists, and creators
- **Share resources** – Collect educational materials and opportunities for action
- **Provide context** – Offer background and references for readers seeking to learn more
- **Support engagement** – Point to concrete ways to contribute to positive change

## Scope

The initial focus is racial justice in America, grounded in the principles of the Black Lives Matter movement. As this section develops, it may expand to related areas—Indigenous rights, workers’ rights, environmental justice—while keeping racial justice as the foundation.

## Approach

This section is intended as a curated resource, not a platform for personal commentary. The goal is to:

- Prioritize linking to Black authors, scholars, and organizations
- Share evergreen resources rather than reactive posts
- Keep the material updated as new information becomes available
- Avoid speaking over those with lived experience

## Note

I am not Black, and I do not speak for the Black community. If you notice anything here that is inaccurate, incomplete, or could be improved, please feel free to contact me at [doug.cuthbertson@gmail.com](mailto:doug.cuthbertson@gmail.com).
