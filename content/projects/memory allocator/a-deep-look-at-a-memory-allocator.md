Doug Lea's allocator, often referred to as [dlmalloc](https://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html), provides implementations of the standard C memory functions `malloc()`, `free()`, `realloc()`, and friends. I need a memory allocator for a personal project and Lea generously put his code in the public domain, so I thought to adapt it to my needs. Note that the latest release in 2023 relicensed it under the ["MIT No Attribution" (MIT-0) License](https://opensource.org/license/mit-0/), which is supposed to be more palatable than the public domain.

The source code, [in a single source file, malloc.c](https://gee.cs.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc.c) and an [optional header, malloc.h](https://gee.cs.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc.h), is a little difficult (for me) to grok all at once. My goals here are to understand:

- how it works.
- its configuration options.
- if and when the code is thread-safe.
- how to build it for Windows, Linux, and possibly other operating systems.
- the key algorithms employed.
- its internal data structures.
- how to use it as a replacement for the C runtime implementation.

I'm not a fan of AI for software development, but I needed a quick outline of how to do this, so I asked ChatGPT to see what it would come up with. It surprised me with a concise outline, so I've adapted its reply into the following outline. It's probably too detailed, but it will do for a starting point. I can adjust it as needed.

## 1 Overview

- [ ] Start with a high-level overview of `dlmalloc`, explaining its purpose and role as a memory allocator.
- [ ] Provide information on the primary goals of `dlmalloc`, such as efficiency, scalability, or low fragmentation.

## 2 Current Behavior

- [ ] Detail the current behavior of `dlmalloc`, focusing on how it handles memory allocation, deallocation, and management.
- [ ] Describe any unique features or characteristics that distinguish `dlmalloc` from other allocators.

## 3 Algorithms

- [ ] Document the key algorithms employed by `dlmalloc`, including but not limited to:
- [ ] Memory Allocation Algorithm: Explain how `dlmalloc` searches for and allocates memory blocks.
- [ ] Memory Deallocation Algorithm: Describe how `dlmalloc` frees memory and manages freed blocks.
- [ ] Internal Data Structures: Highlight the data structures used for efficient bookkeeping.
- [ ] Concurrency Control (if any): Detail how `dlmalloc` handles multiple threads if it's designed to be thread-safe.

## 4 Data Structures

- [ ] Provide detailed information about the primary data structures used by `dlmalloc`.
- [ ] Include diagrams or visual representations to aid understanding.
- [ ] Explain the purpose and relationships between different data structures.

## 5 API Documentation

- [ ] Document the public API of `dlmalloc`, including function signatures, parameters, and return values.
- [ ] Clarify any assumptions or requirements for using the API effectively.

## 6 Usage Examples

- [ ] Include practical usage examples to illustrate how developers can use `dlmalloc` in their code.
- [ ] Cover common scenarios and provide code snippets.

## 7 Configuration Options

- [ ] Document any compile-time or runtime configuration options available in `dlmalloc`.
- [ ] Explain how these options affect the behavior of the allocator.

## 8 Performance Characteristics

- [ ] Discuss the expected performance characteristics of `dlmalloc`.
- [ ] Include information on scalability, throughput, and any trade-offs made for performance.

## 9 Concurrency Considerations

- [ ] If applicable, document how `dlmalloc` handles concurrency and thread safety.
- [ ] Describe any synchronization mechanisms in place.

## 10 Troubleshooting and Debugging

- [ ] Include information on common issues users might encounter and how to troubleshoot them.
- [ ] Provide guidance on debugging techniques for memory-related problems.

## 11 References

- [ ] Include references to relevant academic papers, articles, or other external sources that influenced the design or implementation of `dlmalloc`.

## 12 Changelog

- [ ] If available, provide a changelog documenting major changes, bug fixes, and enhancements across different versions.

## 13 Contributing Guidelines

- [ ] Encourage contributions by including guidelines on how users can contribute to the development or improvement of `dlmalloc`.

## 14 License Information

- [ ] Clearly state the licensing terms under which `dlmalloc` is distributed.

## 15 Feedback Mechanism

- [ ] Provide a way for users to offer feedback or report issues, such as a link to the issue tracker or mailing list.

## 16 Documentation Format

- [ ] Choose a consistent format for documentation, such as Markdown, and ensure that it is easily accessible.
