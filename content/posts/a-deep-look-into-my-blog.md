I want to separate the presentation of my blog from the content so, with any luck, I can create a theme and possibly substitute another more professional theme for the one I've hacked together. I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate this blog, so to have any hope of getting to that place, I need to document the layout, HTML blocks, partials, shortcodes, and CSS components in use.

Documenting your Hugo-based site is a great way to understand its structure and facilitate future theme development. Here's a method you can follow.

## 1 Markdown Documentation

Create a new directory in your project for documentation, e.g., docs.
Inside docs, create markdown files for each aspect you want to document (HTML layout, partials, shortcodes, CSS).
Use clear headings and subheadings to organize information.

## 2 HTML Layout

Describe the overall structure of your site's HTML layout.
Include details about the main layout file and any custom layouts for different sections or content types.
Mention Hugo variables and functions used in the HTML files.

## 3 Partials

List and describe each partial used in your Hugo project.
Explain where these partials are included and how they contribute to the overall layout.

## 4 Shortcodes

Document the shortcodes you've created or are using in your content.
Provide examples of shortcode usage and explain their purpose.

## 5 CSS

Detail the structure of your CSS files.
If you use a preprocessor like Sass, document the file structure and how styles are organized.
Include information about any third-party libraries or frameworks.

## 6 Theme Creation

Outline the steps to create a theme based on your current documentation.
Include guidelines on how to separate presentation from content.
Suggest best practices for theming in Hugo.

## 7 Professional Theme Integration

Research and choose a professionally created Hugo theme that aligns with your design preferences.
Document the steps to integrate the new theme into your project.
Provide instructions for customizing the theme according to your needs.

## 8 Version Control

If you're not doing it already, consider using version control (e.g., Git) for your documentation.
Keep the documentation up-to-date as your project evolves.

## 9 Include Examples and Screenshots

Add examples of code snippets, shortcode usage, and screenshots of your site to make the documentation more visual and user-friendly.

## 10 Test the Documentation

After creating the documentation, test it by having someone else follow the steps to ensure clarity and completeness.
By following these steps, you'll have comprehensive documentation for your Hugo-based site, making it easier to create a theme and transition to a professionally designed one in the future.
