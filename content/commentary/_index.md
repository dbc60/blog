Personal opinions, hot takes, and reactions to current events—particularly political and social issues. This is where I rant, vent, and process what's happening in the world.

## What This Section Is

Unlike the curated, evergreen resources in the [Justice & Equity](/justice/index.html#top) section, this space is for:

- **Timely reactions** – Responses to current political or social events
- **Personal takes** – My own opinions, unpolished and unfiltered
- **Thinking out loud** – Working through complex issues in real time
- **Ephemeral posts** – Content that may age poorly or become obsolete

## What to Expect

- Political commentary and analysis
- Reactions to policy decisions
- Frustrations with the state of things
- Attempts to make sense of current events

These posts will be opinionated, sometimes angry, and occasionally wrong in hindsight. They’re snapshots of my thinking at a particular moment—not carefully researched resources.

## Note on Tone

If you're here for technical content about programming and computer science, you may want to skip this section. The tone, style, and subject matter will be very different from the rest of the blog.

That said, staying silent feels worse than speaking imperfectly.
