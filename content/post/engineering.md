This doesn't have to be my first blog post.

<!--more-->

I can write one or more posts about engineering concepts and principles after
I've had time to think about it a little more.

Wikipedia says

> Engineering is the creative application of science, mathematical methods,
> and empirical evidence to the innovation, design, construction, operation
> and maintenance of structures, machines, materials, devices, systems,
> processes, and organizations.

Merriam-Webster says engineering is

> the application of science and mathematics by which the properties of
> matter and the sources of energy in nature are made useful to people

Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of
software in a systematic method.

After a quick search on the internet, there seems to be no consensus on what constitute a job description for a Software Engineer I, II, III, or Senior Software Engineer I or II. Here's one list of [levels at Google](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-different-levels-of-software-engineers-at-Google).

# Skills

A fellow named Sijin Joseph put together a [Programmer Competency Matrix](http://sijinjoseph.com/2008/04/30/programmer-competency-matrix/) to help evaluate programmers. There are four columns of increasing levels from left to right. Looking at the first row, data structures, level 3 says "Knowledge of advanced data structures like B-trees, binomial and fibonacci heaps, AVL/Red Black trees, Splay Trees, Skip Lists, tries, etc." I suppose a more senior programmer would know why and when to apply these data structures, and that might be the point. However, I've seen junior programmers assigned the task of writing an implementation of skip lists for a specific application.

There are thoughtful comments about its usefulness [here on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9341146) and [another one here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4626695). There are also some very dismissive and derogatory comments. Such is the internet.

One comment I like is that the skills in the matrix only comprise about 15% of what it takes to become a successful software engineer. In addition to those skills, a good engineer needs to communicate at several levels. There's communicating desired behavior to the computer. There's communicating among a team to create something useful. Equally important is communicating with maintainers and your future self.

It's easy to forget code you've written months ago. Properly documenting what you've done and why you did it will help you, maintainers, and testers understand how the code works so it can be extended and refactored without needing to first reverse engineer it.
