This doesn't have to be my first blog post.

<!--more-->

I can write one or more posts about engineering concepts and principles after
I've had time to think about it a little more.

Wikipedia says

> Engineering is the creative application of science, mathematical methods,
> and empirical evidence to the innovation, design, construction, operation
> and maintenance of structures, machines, materials, devices, systems,
> processes, and organizations.

Merriam-Webster says engineering is

> the application of science and mathematics by which the properties of
> matter and the sources of energy in nature are made useful to people

Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of
software in a systematic method.
