Vote for whomever you like, but understand that Trump is tearing apart our country.

- He lied to us Americans about the deadliness of COVID-19 and how easliy it spreads. Now well over 200,000 Americans are dead. Many of those deaths could have been prevented if we had been forewarned and taken precautions.
- He has failed the economy. Many small businesses are failing and may not recover.
- He ripped apart immigrant families and there are now over 500 immigrant children who can't be reunited with their parents.
- He bullies, denigrates, and belittles people who disagree with him or are less powerful than he is so he can feel superior.
- He refuses to denounce white supremicists and actually commanded one group to "stand back and stand by".

Do you really want him to be our president? I don't understand how that's possible.
