A little over three years ago I started a blog on this site with hopes and dreams of writing about things that interested me. At the time, I had little focus, but I thought software development, design patterns, and other topics might be fun. What really happened is that I got bogged down configuring [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), and playing with SCSS to make the site look nice.

I've decided to start over. I'm still using [GitHub user pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/), because it's a cheap and easy way to publish content.

I've been writing software in [Go](https://golang.org/) for nearly a year (it's my new favorite programming language), and came across [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as an alternative static site generator. I wasn't happy with Jekyll, so why not try Hugo as I learn more about my new favorite programming language.

I'm also staying away from CSS. It's a time sink. Hugo has lots of [themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/), and the [Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) has a lot of nice features.
