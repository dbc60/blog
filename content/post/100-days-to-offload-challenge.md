No more waiting for election results. The election turned out fine despite the insurrection on January 6, 2021. It's well past time for me and this blog to move on. Our first destination is The [100 Days To Offload][offload] Challenge.
<!--more-->

The goal of the challenge is to publish 100 posts on your own blog in the span of a year. I don't remember exactly how I came upon it --- probably by following links from some post on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) where a blog post ended in something like "This is day 5 of the [#100DaysToOffload]({{< ref "/tags/100DaysToOffload" >}}) challenge." It made me curious what was going on, and it was timed well as I've really wanted to start making something of this blog for a while.
After a quick search, I found [the site][offload]. The message was encouraging. The goal is to just write about anything you want.

> Posts don’t need to be long-form, deep, meaningful, or even that well written. If there are spelling and grammar mistakes, or even if there’s no real point to the post, so what? What’s important is that you’re writing about the things you want to write about.
>
> Your posts could be how-to guides, or links to another post you have found interesting. They could include your own thoughts about that post, or a response to it. It could be a simple update about what you have done that day. Tell us about your dog, your cat, your fish tank, or whatever hobbies you have. Someone will find it interesting.

The site also has a Hall of Fame section listing people who have completed the challenge. Good for them! What's good for me is I enjoy seeing what others have created for their own personal blogs and use it as inspiration for mine. For example, [Hyde Stevenson](https://lazybear.io/)'s site has a simple, but lovely layout for his list of posts where each one has a picture to the left and a summary to the right.
