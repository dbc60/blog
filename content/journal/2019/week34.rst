It's Adelle's birthday today! I am taking her to see the Dr. Suess Museum in Springfield. I expect we'll also see the art museum in the same compound. After we're done with the museums, we'll drive out to Auburn and have dinner at Jasmine's. It's a very nice Asian restaurant. Ian will be coming up to take care of Tarly while we're out.

It's 9:30 AM and my plans may be dashed. Adelle said she woke up during the night with her heel hurting a lot. She's not sure she will be able to walk the museums. She'll take a prednizone and see if it settles down.

In the meantime, I've texted Ian to tell him not to come out right away. I'll keep him posted as to Adelle's condition.

I thought I'd try to get some projects organized this morning before waking Adelle. I wound up reviewing a description of glob pattern matching I wrote for work, and then fiddling with CSS for my blog.

The next time I get to sit down and think about projects, I want to reflect on two of them; creating a restructuredText parser in Go and integrating that into Hugo, and Evidence Based Software Engineering so I can see if there's a better way to predict how likely the team will meet its deadline for any particular release.

I also want to make project on the home office, we need fresh insulation for the house, and I'd like to finish fixing the grill. There are so many things that need my attention.
