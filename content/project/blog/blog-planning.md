What steps are left to actually launch this blog even though there are styling, presentation, and organizational issues I would like to address?
<!--more-->

What should the cadence of blog posts be? Can I create weekly posts? I think I should be able to post at least monthly.

What content should I post? Just technical or should I include family events? Initially, I think posts should be mostly technical, but I get the feeling that intermixing some personal elements would be okay. Things like my background, where I'm working, my struggles with the commute, my sister's situation, how proud I am of my daughter and son, far away family, friends (my Dojo family in particular), gaming, etc.

- [ ] Consider bringing forward a few of the old posts
  - [A Blog on GitHub](http://douglascuthbertson.com/blog/2015/12/30/blogging-on-github/)
  - Tuck away [A Quick Note on Python](http://douglascuthbertson.com/blog/2016/01/04/a-quick-note-on-python/) as a note until I decide to pursue Python again.
  - maybe keep [Serving a Blog](http://douglascuthbertson.com/blog/2016/09/04/serving-a-blog-site/)
  - [A Dangerous Spectacle](http://douglascuthbertson.com/blog/2016/11/09/the-spectacle/)
- [ ] At least 3 articles exploring the same subject. For example, D3, Python, Go, Project Planning, Hugo, CSS and SCSS, Markdown and reStructuredText, Blogging in general.
- [ ] Have at least 12 articles "in the can" for publication so you have time to work on more.
- [ ] Learn how to use Twitter to annouce new articles, link to news reports so I can express my rage at the Trump administration, and retweet interesting tweets from others.
- [ ] Make tickets on GitHub for work to update the presentation of this blog. These don't have to be done before relaunch. Their purpse is to track changes I want to make.
- [ ] ensure the blog is presentable w/o JavaScript (noscript extension)
- [ ] make a sidebar component and place the navigation menu there.
- [ ] consider a header image. Rotate through 12 monthly, 24 semi-monthly, or as many as 52 weekly header images.
- [ ] I have a lot of notes. I should create series of articles with similar themes. and move them to post with publication dates where possible. It is also okay to have a single post on a single subject - perhaps posting such things between series.
- [ ] Consider subdirectories for the `note/project` folder to help organize project notes. I can see a few directory names:
  - [ ] `anki`. Keep notes about learning, using, and styling anki cards.
  - [ ] `hugo`. Keep notes about learning, using, and configuring it.
  - [ ] `web`. Move `note/web` under `note/project` and write about HTML, CSS, SCSS, and file organization in web projects (like this blog).
  - [ ] `filing`. Write about struggles with keeping paper files organized.
  - [ ] `budget` or `finanaces`. Ways of keeping a budget, making investments, and managing money.
  - [ ] `gaming`. Play. Games online and offline.
  - [ ] `game development`. Handmade Hero, and other inspirations. Tools. Techniques. Although, either the `project` directory may be enough or put this under the `project` directory.
  - [ ] `graphics`. D3, sketching, and related thoughts on visual design and presetation.
  - [ ] `home renovation`. The kitchen cabinet project, and others.
  - [ ] `book reviews`. That might motivate me to read more and take notes on technical books.

## Categories

Think of categories as entries in a table of contents for your website, and tags as index entries. Use categories sparingly. Each blog post should have one or no more than two categories assigned. `One site <organize your blog design with categories and tags_>`_ recommends limitiing yourself to a total of 10 categories across the site.

One way to display categories is to list the applicable ones at the top of each blog post. Another way is to place them in a sidebar, perhaps in a column like a table of contents. You can certainly do both.

My goal is to assign a category to each post and note. Here is my initial list.

1. [x] career: experiences on the job, titles, job search, promotion, and progression.
1. [ ] devops: windows, linux, computer administration, scripts, and automation, but not general programming.
1. [ ] food: dining, recipes, and other food-related topics.
1. [ ] games: all about games, their design, processes for creating them, gameplay, game development, and playing games. This is not necessarily the software aspect of game development.
1. [ ] hobbies: photography, woodworking, sketching, art, design, writing, blogging, model railroads, steampunk.
1. [ ] martial arts: kempo, karazempo goshin jitsu, kendo, Indonesian stick and knife, etc.
1. [ ] math: notes focused entirely on math.
1. [ ] personal finance: money, budgeting, saving, spending.
1. [ ] personal goals: my notes on what I want to achieve in the coming years, months, and weeks.
1. [ ] personal productivity: planning projects; organizing projects, and files and file plans; removing clutter; how to get things done.
1. [ ] personal projects: kitchen renovation, home office, and other projects.
1. [ ] software: reviews of software tools and programs for various tasks. These could include ledger, excel, anki, hugo, krita, blender, visual studio, editors, etc.
1. [ ] software development: the acts of dreaming, planning, designing, and writing software. I should probably include computer science related topics, such as AI, neural networks, data structures, and algorithms. Also, consider including tools and processes like version control, continuous deployment, continuous integration, programming, and parallel programming and concurrency.

I had considered "learning" to be a category, but the more I think about it, the more I think it should be a tag to apply to posts and notes in other categories.

## Tags

Tags are more like index entries. Several tags are likely to apply to each post, so they should be used more generously than categories. To help you choose tags that fit a post, think of an index and what entries you would like to see there to use to find that post.

One way to display tags is to list the applicable ones at either the top or bottom of a blog post. I suppose it wouldn't hurt to have a tag page that lists the complete set of tags across all posts. It might be easier than having a tag cloud or other arrangement in a sidebar.

## Progress

- 2019.07.05: I created a draft blog post, [Evidence-Based Software Engineering]({{< ref "evidence-based-software-engineering.md" >}}). It needs some refinement. I should review and probably condense the sections describing the process, and make my own opions stand out - maybe by placing them at the beginning of each section as an introduction, just before parroting the original article.
