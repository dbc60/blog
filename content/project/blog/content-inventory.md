Content Inventory is a simple list of the current content here, including notes, projects, and posts. I plan on using this list to determine what content I have, what notes can be turned into additional content, and where content gaps may lie so I have a better idea of what to write in the near term.
<!--more-->

- post
  - a dangerous spectacle: disappointment about Trump being elected in 2016.
  - a quick note on python: an incomplete thought and scattered content somewhat relating to Python.
  - basic web design: a disorganized draft on HTML, BEM, directory layout, and information copied from other sources. I need to inject original thoughts, and possible compare and contrast different approaches to web design.
  - blogging on github: incomplete and not very informative.
  - evidence-based software engineering: a mostly complete draft post. Needs refinement to make it my own.
  - fixing the width: an old post about frustration with CSS. Perhaps I could incorporate it or relate it to my thoughts on and experience with BEM.
  - pursuit of happiness: an amalgamation of internal doubts, and how to fight them. Needs work, as it's not focussed enough and needs elaboration to show where I was going with it. At the moment, it's probably pointless.
  - serving a blog: another old post. Not very cohesive. Needs work.
- note
  - career
    - 2018 performance review: personal and private.
    - architect: position description.
    - interview questions
    - job search
    - programming puzzles: relates to "interview questions"
