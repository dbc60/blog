Here are some notes on why I want to have a blog. It includes, reasons, thoughts, and inspirations for a blog. I'll use them to me design my blog.
<!--more-->

My reasons for having a blog are:

- I want to show potential employers the kind of engineer I am.
- By referencing my work in GitHub repositories, I will show others elegant code, and elegant solutions to problems.
- I want to be better at writing.
- I think it will provide motivatation to be more creative and to more actively explore art and design.
- I want a platform/soapbox to present/state/establish my skills (and limitations) in programming, design, reasoning, writing, communication, drawing/sketching, and creativity in general.
- I can learn where I enjoy spending my leisure time. Which hobbies and interests do I want to pursue more actively? I have interests in Kempo, computing, programming, model railroading, gardening, sketching, drawing, gardening, gaming, traveling, keeping up with family and friends, history, mythology - there are so many things I'd like to purue. I need more focus to know what is realistic.
- I need to repair my career after far too many years of letting it drift without aim or goals. I feel a blog in combination with projects on GitHub will help ensure the remainder of my career will be more successful.
- It can be a resource from which others can learn.
- It will open up discussions from which I can learn from others.
- It may also help me learn how to focus, get things done, declutter my life so I can pursue my goals, and figure out what my *real* goals are.

Phrases, parts, and thoughts to consider for personal mission statements:

- arise each day with a light heart and a smiling face.
- live by the highest standard of moral character and integrity.
- love, respect, encourage, and defend my family and friends.
- I'm a noble steward of the resources entrusted to me.

The phrase "noble steward" at first struck me as too flowery or grandiose for my taste. On the other hand, it evokes images of heroes and behaviors to which I aspire. Maybe it's okay to make such statements to establish my aspirations and guide my thinking about goals to pursue/achieve.

## Motivations and Guidelines for Creating Mission Statements

An old book, Web Style Guide: Basic Design Principles for Creating Web Sites, by Patrick J. Lynch and Sarah Horton, list six questions to help focus a team as they design and develop a web site. The questions are:

- What is the mission of your organization?
- How will creating a web site support your mission?
- What are your immediate goals for the site?
- What are your long-term goals for the site?
- What web-related strategies will you use to achieve those goals?
- How will you measure the success of your site?

Rewording to make them more personal and immediate, they become:

- What is my mission?
- How will creating a blog support my mission?
- What are my immediate goals for the blog?
- What are my long-term goals for the blog?
- What web-related strategies will I use to achieve those goals?
- How will I measure the success of my blog?

Why should I create a personal mission statement? Several sites I visited say it is a powerful tool for making important decisions about what you will and won't accept in your life. When something comes up that is outside those boudaries, you will hardly spend a moment excluding it.

A mission statement needs to be based on, at least in part, one's principles. Your principles, clearly written down, will guide your decisions, and no matter what they are, help you maintain your integrity.

When confronted with projects, requests, or opportunities, ask yourself questions like:

- Is this part of who I am?
- Is this part of who I am working to become?
- Is it part of my purpose in life?

Your mission statement will help you find good answers these or similar questsions. When you make good decisions, you discover what really fills your life with a sense of passion, purpose, and direction.

## Defining My Mission

A mission statement is also referred to a one's personal brand. A mission needs to include your enthusiasms for life. If you have no passion for your mission, then it isn’t really your mission.

- I am passionate about writing code that is clear and easy to understand.
- I am passionate about kempo. It is so much fun to move with power and minimal effort.
- I value personal integrity.
- What else do I value?
- My interests are wide and varied.
  - kempo
  - model railroading
  - coding, algorithms, making computers do interesting things.
  - gaming - board games, computer games, competitive games.
  - I want to learn to write, sketch, and draw better.
- Nouns that describe me: engineer, programmer, puzzler, introvert.
- Verbs that describe how I like to be in the world: teacher (of the things I'm confident), learner.
- A perfect world is a place where people are friendly, thoughtful, considerate of others in their community, welcoming to strangers, and just let others be themselves.

What's fair in such a community? How does one participate, and to what degree must a person participate in their community? This line of thought has suddenly gone far afield from defining a mission statement for my blog.

Maybe a perfect world is where different people hold a different opinions for things we haven't shown to be true or false, are encouraged to figure out how things work, can safely share their ideas, and are respected even by those who disagree. For those things people have shown to be true (through a reasonable application of the scientific method), people generally accept, but are allowed to question through reason and evidence - not mere belief.

I don't know anything about [Andy Andrews](https://www.andyandrews.com/), but he has some advice on [creating a personal mission statement](https://www.andyandrews.com/personal-mission-statement/) that looks good. He starts with five questions to ask yourself each day to guide you toward creating a personal mission statement:

1. **What is important?** What/whom do you value? How is your life connected to those things?
1. **Where do I want to go?** You can answer this many different ways. Your answer may involve a sprirtual, mental, or physical destination. It might describe your career arc.
1. **What does "the best" look like for me?** Describe your best possible result. This isn't the time to be realistic. This is the time to dream.
1. **How do I want to act?** How do you want people to describe you? Think of a few words you would want to come to mind when people think about you.
1. **What kind of legacy do I want to leave behind?** Imagine you're 100 years in the future. What does the impact you've left look like? How is you Butterfly Effect still touching lives?

Write down your answers to these questions and revisit them often. As you continue thinking about them, start giving your personal mission statement a shot.

A few guidelines:

- **Keep it short**. You want this to be something you can sum up in a single sentence. Remember, this is about focusing your life on what matters most! Boundaries will help you keep that focus.
- **Don’t forget about others**. Yes, this is a personal mission statement, but it should be just as much about the people you want to impact as it is about yourself. Make sure that shows.
- **Share it with the most important people in your life**. Get feedback from your spouse, your mentors, and any other important people in your life. They can provide you with invaluable insight.
- **It’s OK to make changes**. As you grow and continue learning, your mission might evolve. That’s natural. As long as you’re staying true to the mission you know you were put here to accomplish, you can’t go wrong.

### Personal Logo

I'm thinking about using a drawing or sketch of a simple machine to indicate engineering. It will be a picture derived from my mission/vision statement.

I want to keep my logo simple and clean:

- **Shape or symbol**: Symbols are powerful. Create your logo so that it’s easy to understand and see without glasses.
- **Color**: Use the color(s) that you consistently employ to represent your personal brand. Use colors that attract the people you want to attract. Most logos use vibrant colors in order to have the greatest impact.
- **Size**: When you place your logo into your materials, it should be large enough to see clearly and small enough that it doesn’t dominate. (Make sure that you have your logo in a file format that allows you to resize it for various projects.)
- **Brand connection**: Think about how you want people to emotionally connect with you. Find a symbol that you care about and use it to connect with others.

### Personal Branding

Here is a cheat sheet to help develop a mission and personal brand from [Personal Branding for Dummies](https://www.dummies.com/careers/find-a-job/personal-branding/personal-branding-for-dummies-cheat-sheet/):

The first step in the personal branding process is to spend time figuring out who you really are and what you want from your life. Often, this self-analysis is the hardest part. Here are the building blocks of your brand that you need to identify:

- **Needs**: Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs is a helpful tool that shows layers of needs from the most basic (physiological needs, such as food) all the way up to self-actualization — becoming everything that you are capable of becoming.
- **Values**: These are core principles that give meaning to your life — a set of standards that determine your attitudes, choices, and actions.
- **Interests/passions**: The things that intrigue and motivate you determine how you want to spend your time.
- **Mission**: Everyone should have a mission statement — an expression that clarifies what you are all about and what you want to do in life.
- **Vision**: Your ideal version of how you will use your mission is your vision.
- **Strengths**: Certain abilities and patterns of interest consistently produce a positive outcome in your life, and these are your strengths.
- **Freak factor**: This term refers to a unique quality that makes you different and unusual.
- **Personality attributes**: Describing the face that you show to the world helps you define your personality.
- **Education and work experience**: These attributes are easy to identify because they’re based on fact.
- **360º feedback**: The people who know you best (such as friends and coworkers) can provide key information about your character.
- **Goals**: Getting specific about what you want to achieve greatly increases your chances of success.
- **Target market positioning statement**: This tool identifies how your brand will be positioned in your target market. It puts into words what makes your brand important and unique so that the people who need to know about you can clearly understand what you represent.

## New Inspiration
I looked at a Jekyll theme called [hyde](https://github.com/JuanjoSalvador/hyde). It has several simplifications I like, so I'm going to try to pull in some of its CSS/SCSS to my notes and my blog. As I do that, I will keep in mind the four principles of design from Robin Williams' book, The Non-Designer's Design Book:

- Contrast
- Repetition
- Alignment
- Proximity

One of the things wrong with my current design is the content stays centered on the browser. I will left align the entire page. I also want to put my sidebar on the left. However, it currently contains the yearly index. The Hyde theme pushes it's left sidebar up above the main content. I think I want my sidebar to drop to the end as it does now. The index can happily drop to the end, I think. I'd only have the sidebar pop up to the top if I changed its purpose. I'd still have to find a place for an index. I consider it valuable for navigating my notes. Maybe a menu link. I'll have to think about it.

## Inspirations for the Overall Layout and Design
The [Modern Studio Pro](http://my.studiopress.com/themes/modern-studio/#demo-full) theme for wordpress uses a 300x300 px logo. The logo, heading and navigation bar look good for this theme. I also like the layout of the left sidebar. It has blocks with nice headings for About Me, Connect, Newletter, Recent Posts, Instagram, or whatever you want to put down the column.

On the other hand, I like the footer of [Eleven40 Pro](http://my.studiopress.com/themes/eleven40/#demo-full), as well as being able to place an image to the left, right or on top of a post. The footer has large three sections across the majority of its space:

- Recent Posts containing a list of the six most recent posts.
- About with a short, three sentence description.
- Tag and Social Icons are stacked in the third column.

There's a second row that spans all three columns with a copyright statement and links to social network sites. The demo includes Dribbble, Facebook, Google+, Instagram, Twitter and Contact, the last of which could be a link to another page, or just to `mail://myemailaddress@example.com`.

I extracted the following CSS from the Modern Studio theme, because I'm curious about the Unicode values. These are not valid Unicode characters. For example [FileFormat.info](http://www.fileformat.info/index.htm) shows ["\e915"](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/e915/index.htm) as invalid. In fact, the range [from U+E000 to U+F8FF](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/private_use_area/index.htm) is designated as the 'Private Use Area'.

```css
.icon-logo-genesis:before {
  content: "\e914";
}
.icon-logo-rm:before {
  content: "\e915";
}
.icon-logo-sp-outline:before,
.icon-StudioPress:before {
  content: "\e916";
}
.icon-logo-sp:before {
  content: "\e917";
}
.icon-logo-wp:before {
  content: "\e918";
}

// FYI: logo.png is a 300x300 px image
.logo {
  background: url(images/logo.png) no-repeat;
  display: block;
  height: 16px;
}
```

## Inspiration for Logos and Icons
I want an icon that portrays the concepts of dreaming, sketching and coding. It should fit in a 300x300 pixel image. I'm thinking of a sketch of a pencil and pad of paper, where the sketch on the paper includes the moon and stars (dreaming) and several lines of colored bars so the colors look like syntax highlighted lines of source code.

Icons should come in several standard sizes. The standard sizes are all square, but are different depending on the particular operating system:
