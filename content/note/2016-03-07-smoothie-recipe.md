This recipe is a variation on [The Perfect Pre-workout Green Smoothie Recipe](http://simplegreensmoothies.com/green-smoothie-recipes/pre-workout-green-smoothie). That site suggests serving it 30-60 minutes either before or after a workout. Feel free to adjust the ingredients and quantities to suit your own taste. This recipe makes about 2 16oz servings.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups greens (fresh spinach, Swiss chard, and/or kale, and parsley)
- 2 cups almond milk, unsweetened
- 1 large apple, cored, any variety (optional - I substitute the frozen fruit below)
- 1 banana
- 5 frozen pineapple chunks (frozen fruit helps chill the smoothie)
- 5 frozen strawberries
- 1/3 cup oat flour made from rolled oats
- 1 scoop muscle milk or similar protein powder

## Directions
Place all ingredients in a *real* blender (one with a lot of power, like a Blendtec or Vitamix) and run the "smoothie" function, or in a regular blender make your smoothie in two steps:

1. Blend greens and almond milk until smooth.
2. Add remaining ingredients, and blend until smooth.
