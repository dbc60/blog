The goal of Evidence-Based Software Engineering (EBSE) is to help practioners and software menagers make better decisions about what technologies to employ on their projects.

> The aim of EBSE is to provide the means by which current best evidence from research can be integrated with practical experience and human values in the decision making process regarding the development and maintenance of software.
