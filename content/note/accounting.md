## Fundamental Concepts
Some basic terms and definitions:

- Accounting
: A set of concepts and techniques that are used to measure and report financial information about an economic unit.

- Financial Accounting
: Encompasses external reporting issues.

- Managerial Accounting
: Encompasses internal reporting issues.

- Historical Cost Principle
: The concept that many transactions and events are to be measured and reported at acquisition cost (in contrast to fair value). This principle is based on the concept that it is best to report certain financial statement elements at amounts that are tied to _objective_ and verifiable past transactions.

- Fair Value Cost
: The alternative to the historical cost principle is to value (and periodically revalue) accounts based on _subjective_ assessments of current worth.

The Fundamental Accounting Equation is `Assets = Liabilities + Equity`. This equality is preserved as transactions are processed through an accounting system.

Different types of financial statements include the:

- Income Statement.
- Statement of Retained Earnings.
- Balance Sheet.
- Statement of Cash Flows.
