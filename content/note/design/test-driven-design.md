This is just a list from [Ask HN: Help me see why everyone seems to love TDD?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12179756). It is mostly about "selling" TDD to your employer.

1. A change in your current process must be "sold" in the business context of $$savings (faster dev cycle, lower number of bugs, lower cost of support) or increase in developer productivity/utilization or increase in customer satisfaction.
1. Inadequate unit testing almost always correlates to greater defects in the support/maintenance cycle. So I would recommend gathering some data around it: for e.g., number of open support tickets, hours spent fixing such defects, regression testing etc etc. This must translate to either $$ or Hours "wasted" or additional head-count (required to deal with tickets).
1. Identify a small but meaningful project to pilot out the TDD process. You will eventually have to develop your flavor of TDD within the constraints of your organization (people, tools, process...)
1. Run the process for a few months and then compile the "before and after" data. Be prepared for disappointment. Process improvements are not always quick or visible at the surface.
1. Management avoids things they don't fully understand. Most managers hear "better unit testing" and hear "more time and effort". Instead, they should hear "lower downstream issues, lower support costs, better builds, happier users".

So, can you help them understand the issue better? Just make sure YOU understand why unit testing matters to your company.
