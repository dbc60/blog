I created this page to capture what I learn about design. The first things I learned about design were from Robin Williams' book, The Non-Designer's Design Book.

Williams organizes design around four principles:

- Contrast
- Repetition
- Alignment
- Proximity

which creates an acronym (CRAP) as a simple mnemonic for the principles.
