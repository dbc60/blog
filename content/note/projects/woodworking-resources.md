Woodworking is an important skill. Here are some resources I've found on the 'net for learning some basic woodworking skills. I'm going to try to emphasize those that avoid expensive power tools.

## Woodworking Resources
My information starts with [this post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12995244) on Hacker News. The link, [Beginning Woodworking](http://woodgears.ca/beginner/) is to an article on Mathias Wandel's site, but according to the comments, he favors power tools. Some of the commenters have recommendations for books and sites where more hand tools are used, making woodworking less expensive. Nevertheless, I read the article and it didn't seem unreasonable. He also has a lot of really cool projects and information on woodworking.

## Lists of Tools
There are lots of recommendations for sets of woodworking tools.

### Hacker News
One person suggested the following tools to get started. These should cost around $200-300.

- A rip saw and a cross cut saw (or a Japanse Ryoba, which as both)
- 4 chisels: 1/4", 1/2", 3/4", 1"
- A #4 smoothing plane (if you have a good workbench or intend to build one)
- OR a low angle block plane (if you don't have a bench)
- Sharpening equipment because tools don't come sharp out of the box
- A saw file if you get a re-sharpenable saw
- Optional: a coping saw or a fret saw, depending on what kind of joinery you're into.

### Charles H. Hayward
According to Popular Woodworking's article [Tools for Woodworking](http://www.popularwoodworking.com/tools/tools_for_woodwork), Hayward was a 20th-century woodworking writer who had been traditionally trained in professional English shops. He wrote many books on woodworking. All of his books are out of print, but can be found on the internet.

Hayward's book, "Tools for Woodwork" explains how to use most basic hand tools and handheld power tools. At the back of that book is a "suggested kit for the main taking up woodwork seriously." I copied the list from Popular Woodworking's article [Tools for Woodwork](http://www.popularwoodworking.com/tools/tools_for_woodwork). The numbers in parentheses correspond with the numbers in the [PDF illustration](({{ site.url }}/assets/Woodworking/Tools_Woodwork.pdf)

#### The Preliminary Tool Kit
These are the hand tools Hayward says you should pruchase before you cut your first stick of wood.

- (1) Crosscut handsaw, 22": This is technically a panel saw. It is useful for breaking down large planks before flattening them.
- (2) Backsaw, 10": Presumably a carcase saw and filed crosscut. Thsi tool will make your finishing cuts and is typically used with the bench hook.
- (3) Doevetail saw, 8": Popular Woodworking prefers a 15-point saw that is filed for ripping cuts.
- (7) Jack plane: Hayward seems to prefer this plane for processing rough lumber. A 14"-long plane is typical.
- (8) Fore plane: Harward seems to prefer this size plane (about 18") for shooting the edges of boards instead of a jointer plane.
- (9) Smoothing plane: The smoothing plane is the last plane to touch the work before scrapers or sandpaper. A 10"-long plnae is a typical size.
- (15) Firmer chisels, 1/4" and 34": These were once common tools without the beveled edges taht are common in catalogs today.
- (18) Warrington hammer: These small hammers have a cross-pane on one end for starting brad nails. Very handy and still available.
- (21) Mallet, 5" head. For driving chisels. Beech is th epreferred wood.
- (20) Nail punch, fine: A small tool for setting nail heads below the wood's surface with a few short blows.
- (22) Pincers: an handy tool for pulling errant nails.
- (23 and 24) Screwdrivers, 8" and 3": Traditionally, these would be straight drivers. You'll also need philips, square-drive and others.
- (25) Cutting gauge: A marking tool with a knife for making its mark (instead of a pin).
- (28) Ratcheting brace, 8": Still useful, even in a power-tool shop.
- (29) Auger bit, 3/8".
- (30) Twist or brad-point bit, 3/16".
- (31) Countersink bit.
- (32) Center bit, 3/4": A bit for making flat-bottomed holes. Now Forstners are the standard.
- (33) Brad awl: Desighned to start holes for nails and small screws.
- (34) Try square, 6"
- (41) Card scraper: THis tools cleans up tear-out left by the smoothing plane.
- (42) Oilstone: Buy one with coarse and fine grits. Waterstones are common now.
- (43) Folding rule: or a tape measure.

#### Useful Additional Tools
The following tools should be added to your kit as you encouter a need for them when building indiviual projects.

- (4) Bow saw, 12": This saw is useful for deep and curved cuts.
- (53) Keyhole saw: USed for fine work, particularly keyholes. These days one with a Japanese tooth pattern is more common and useful.
- (54) Coping saw: Useful for clearing out waste between dovetails and shallow curved cuts.
- (11) Bullnose plane: A now-uncommon tool for cleanign up rabbets.
- (56) Shoulder plane: A useful tool for trimming the cheeks and shoulders of tenons.
- (55) Compass plane: If you do circular work, this plane is helpful. Others never need it.
- (12) Rabbet plane: For the woodworkder who prefers to cut rabbets by hand.
- (13) Toothing plane: A useful plane for roughing up surfaces prior to veneering.
- (10) Plow plane: A useful hand tool for making grooves and small rabbets. Not found in a typical power-tool shop.
- (15) Firmer chisels, 1/8" and 1/2".
- (16) Paring chisel, 1-1/2": Useful for a wide variety of fine cuts. Beveled edges are typical.
- (17) Mortise chisels, 5/16": If you work with machine-processed stock, you'll probably want a 1/4" tool instead.
- (19) Patternmaker's hammer: Like the Warrington next to it, but smaller (see the PDF image).
- (26) marking gauge: A gauge with a pin used for marking across and with the grain.
- (27) Mortise guage: A marking gauge with two cutters to mark the two walls of amortise simultaneously.
- (44) Spokeshave, wood body: Useful for curved shapes in easy-to-cut woods.
- (29) Auger bits, 1/4" and 1/2".
- (32) Center bits, 1" or as required: Again, substittue Forstners. Buy them as you need them.
- (47) Sash clamps, 36": Begin with one pair and purchase as needed.
- (49) C-clamps: A modern equivalent would also be F-style clamps.
- (48) Handscrews: Usefl for all sorts of tapered and odd workholding needs.
- (35) Try square or combination square, 12".
- (37) Miter square: Useful for laying out and checking mitered work.
- (38) Sliding bevel, 8": For makring and measuring angles other than 90&deg;.
- (45) Gouge: A large tool for removing large amounts of wood quickly - not a carving tool.
- (58) Surform tool: I looks like a cheese grater and is used for shaping curved and compound work, such as cabriole legs.
- (57) Router plane: USed to trim tenon cheeks, deepen grooves and to cut hinge mortiese.
- (61) Dividers: Basic tools that step off dovetails or other joinery.

#### Homemade Tools and Jigs
Hayward also showed several homemade devices that make your hand tools work more accurately. He called them "appliances"; Popular Woodworking calls them "very useful."

- (5) Miter block: A sawing device used to help cut small miters.
- (6) Miter box: A more complex and accurate device for cutting miters in mouldings.
- (14) Shooting board, 36" long: An appliance used to plane the long edges of boards true.
- (39) Straightedge: Make as many as you need: they're wood.
- (36) Square, 24": Useful for laying out joinery full-scale on cabinet sides.
- (40) Winding sticks: Two identically sized, straight sticks used to check boards for twisting and cupping.
- (42) Oilstone case.
- (50) Veneering hammer: This tool presses veneer against its sbustrate.
- (46) Bench hook: An essential appliance for accurate crosscuts with a handsaw.
- (59) Scratch stock: A small tool with homemade cutters filed to cut small shapes, such as beads.
- (60) Miter template: An appliance clamped to your work that allows you to chisel accurate miters.

#### The Necessary Power Equipment
In addition to that list of hand tools, Popular Woodworking thinks the well-equipped shop should start with these pieces of power equpment.

- \\(\square\\) 10" table saw
- \\(\square\\) 8" jointer
- \\(\square\\) 12" benchtop planer
- \\(\boxtimes\\) 1/2" drill
- \\(\boxtimes\\) Random-orbit sander
- \\(\boxtimes\\) Drill press or hollow-chisel mortiser
- \\(\boxtimes\\) Jigsaw or band saw
- \\(\square\\) Two-base router kit (2hp) (my router is only 1hp)
- \\(\boxtimes\\) 10" miter saw

The $8 model is not well made - it flexes when you tighten it. There's a YouTube video for [modifying it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojzzCXq5ook) by Lie-Nielson Toolworks.
