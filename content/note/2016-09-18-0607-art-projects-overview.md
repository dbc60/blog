excerpt: I've decided I'm going to learn how to use Krita and Blender to make 2D and 3D digital art.

I should probably record key bindings as they come up, and workflow patterns.

## Environment
One article [^2] recommends the optional step of setting up [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) on a dedicated desktop. The reasoning behind this step is Linux works on older computers that are no longer sufficient for the latest version of Windows. However, I find Windows 10 runs fine on my 6+ year old desktop.

That said, Linux Mint is a derivative of Ubuntu for users who don't want to fiddle as much with setup and just need multimedia capabilities out of the box. I'd say Fedora or maybe CentOS might work. They are derived from RedHat, but I don't know if they are as simple as Linux Mint is purported to be.

Once some OS is up-and-running on your desktop, install [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). It is a full-stack 3D graphic design suite: modeling, rendering, rigging, animation, video editing and game creation in one package. The downside of Blender is the learning curve.

For those who don't need a full-stack production studio but just want to render a quick shape, the author says [Wings 3D](http://www.wings3d.com/) is a great alternative. It is designed to quickly create a mesh model, put a skin on it and render it. The downside is it depends on an Erlang environment and it's limited to OpenGL rendering.

If you need a vector editor, then [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) is the best open source tool you can find. It's great for quickly creating an icon, button, banner or diagram.

[Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) is a good general-purpose graphics paint program. Personally, I think [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) is a worthwhile competitor to Gimp.

[POVRay](http://www.povray.org/) is an old-school ray-tracing engine and I have fond memories of generating 3D images with it. The author mentions [YafaRay](http://www.yafaray.org/) as a POVRay alternative. It has a front end in Blender, so it might be worth a look, too.

## Workflow

Here's one workflow I've seen in a tutorial on using Blender to model a 3D dinosaur [^1]. The artists started with a rough sketch in Krita and then refined it over a few iterations. The result was a nice colored sketch of one view of his dinosaur.

He then searched for, downloaded and installed a modeling package for blender. It essentially made it possible to use Blender like Pixologic's Sculptris or ZBrush products. He then copied and pasted his image from Krita into Blender and used it as a reference for the general shape of his 3D dinosaur model.
