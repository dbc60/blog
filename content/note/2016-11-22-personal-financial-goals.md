## Financial Goals

- A safety net of six to twelve months of expenses in a savings account for quick and easy access to cover being out of work.
- A second source of income, so I'm never without revenue.
- An emergency fund of around $1000.00 to cover smaller unexpected events (such as a major car repair, or replacing a large appliance).
- An emergency fund of $20,000.00 to cover larger unexpected events (heating system failure, medical emergencies, emergency travel to relatives and friends).
- Retirement investments
- Manage my sister's trust fund so she can live a better life.

## Recommendations
I've heard people, both financial experts and not, give the following advice.

- Have an emergency fund to cover six months of average monthly expenses so you can focus on getting your next job w/o having to stress over paying bills.
- For 2 years, live on 50% of your income to save up 1 year of income. On the third year, divide that savings by 12 and use that as a slaary for a year while collecting another year. Repeat. You'll have steady income and always be able to cover a year of expenses.
    - This is likely to be very difficult, if not impossible. A more realistic goal is to live on 67-75% of your income for 3-4 years, while saving the remaining 25-33%.
    - When you have a full year's expenses saved, use that as your salary and stash away all of your income for the next year. This has a couple of nice benefits. First, as soon as you have a year's expenses saved, you'll be stashing away 100% of your income. The following year you'll have a larger amount of money to use toward whatever you want or need. Secondly, you will always be able to budget a full year ahead.

## Debt Reduction Methods
There are two methods for reducing debt. They are the Debt Snowball Method and the Debt Avalanche Method. The Snowball Method says kill the smallest debt first. The Avalanche Method says pay off the one with the largest interest rate first (or maybe the largest interest payments first).

The idea behind the Snowball Method is that you get a psychological boost from little wins along the way. These give you the energy to continue paying down your total debt with the larger debts.

The Avalanche method ensures you pay down your debts as fast as possible provided you continue to work at it. It will take longer to payoff the first one, but the others will come more quickly as you apply all the money that went into the first one to those smaller debts.

There's an app called Ready For Zero. It works via the Avalanche method, but it also gives you little alerts and encouragement along the way.

## Dave Ramsey Advice
I'm looking into [Dave Ramsey's website](http://www.daveramsey.com/get-started/debt). He has seven baby step to building wealth and getting out of debt:

1. Save $1,000 emergency fund
1. Pay off all debt using the snowball method
1. Save 3-6 months of expenses
1. Save 15 percent for retirement
1. Start a college fund for the kids
1. Pay off the house
1. Build wealth and give

### Get Out of Debt
He has a prescription for getting out of debt.

1. List your debts in order from smallest "total payoff" balance to the largest.
1. Attack debt by paying as much as you can on your smallest payoff balance to get quick wins. Make only minimum payments on al the other debts and put everything you can into the first debt.
1. Once you've paid off something, move that entire payment to the next item on the list. As paymenbts roll over, watch how fast your payoffs grow.

Here's an example where we have $300/month to put toward three credit cards. Initially we start with:

| Debts | Total Payoff | Min Payment | New Payment |
|:------|-------------:|------------:|------------:|
| Credit Card 1 | 1000 | 18 | 195 |
| Credit Card 2 | 3000 | 45 | 45 |
| Credit Card 3 | 5000 | 60 | 60 |

When the first card is paid off we roll its payment into the second card:

| Debts | Total Payoff | Min Payment | New Payment |
|:------|-------------:|------------:|------------:|
| ~~Credit Card 1~~ | ~~1000~~ | ~~18~~ | ~~195~~ |
| Credit Card 2 | 3000 | 45 | 240 |
| Credit Card 3 | 5000 | 60 | 60 |

When the second is paid off, we roll its payment into the third:

| Debts | Total Payoff | Min Payment | New Payment |
|:------|-------------:|------------:|------------:|
| ~~Credit Card 1~~ | ~~1000~~ | ~~18~~ | ~~195~~ |
| ~~Credit Card 2~~ | ~~3000~~ | ~~45~~ | ~~240~~ |
| Credit Card 3 | 5000 | 60 | 300 |

### Ramsey's Budget Advice
Use a zero-based budget. Write down your total take-home income (after taxes and other deductions). Include full-time jobs, second jobs, freelance pay, Social Security checks and any other ongoing sources of income.

The next step is to write down all of your expenses. These include regular bills (mortgage, utilities, etc), and irregular bills such as quarterly insurance payments and town property taxes. Add in your other costs, like food, gas and entertainment. Account for every dollar.

Subtract your expenses from income to equal zero. This is the zero-based budget. If your income minus your expenses doesn't equal zero, then check your math and adjust how much money you set aside for each category of expenses until they do reach zero.

Finally, track your expenses throught the month.

## Budgeting Notes
I spend about $800/month on utilities. That's outrageous! Mobile phone are the most expensive part, but I need mine for work, and Adelle, Ian and Lynn should have phones as well. I'll have to see if there are some ways to reduce the cost.

The next highest is internet/TV/land-line package. I need those, too. The others are gas, electric, sewer and water. There's got to be a way to reduce the mobile phone costs.

I also need to get rid of storage units. They are a huge drain on my budget. It's time to sell stuff and make room at home.
