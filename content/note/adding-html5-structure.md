Sections and outlines in HTML5
<!--more-->

## Mozilla Recommendations
I'm following the recommendations from the [Sections and Outlines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document) part of the [Mozilla HTML5 Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5). It starts out with an important note:

> There are currently no known implementations of the [outline](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#outline) algorithm in graphical browsers or assistive technology user agents, although the algorithm is implemented in other software such as conformance checkers. Therefore the outline algorithm cannot be relied upon to convey document structure to users. Authors are advised to use heading [rank](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#rank) ([h1](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements)-[h6](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sections.html#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements)) to convey document structure.
