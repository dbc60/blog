## Current Employment
I work for Threat Stack, Inc., 55 Summer Street, Boston, MA. I'm on the Agent Team, also known as the Committee to Release Agents to Production (CRAP). Specifically, I _am_ the _Windows_ Agent Team (so, I work on Windows CRAP).

## Some Advice for Finding a New Job
These notes are taken from a [blog post](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/5-key-learnings-from-the-post-bootcamp-job-search-9a07468d2331#.kxrh48tuk) by a junior programmer who spent three months looking for a job after taking a 12 week coding bootcamp (Hack Reactor). While he's young and very junior, he is also smart. As an introduction, he plotted his "recruiting funnel" that shows the number of jobs to which he applied and the numbers of each job opportunity that reached each stage of his job search. His funnel stages were:

1. Applied (291)
1. Phone Screen (32)
1. Technical Interview (16)
1. Coding Challenge (13)
1. Onsite (11)
1. Offer (8)

It's a good way to measure the success of your process. Sales (or rather the Business Development Representatives) at work have a funnel to determine if companies qualify as a good sales prospect.

This guys process actually got him offers that ranged from $60-125k for both front end and full stack roles. His initial process wasn't working very well, so he changed tactics and actually worked very hard along the way. I'd say he really learned how to sell himself. Here are the lessons he learned along the way.

### Get Through to Real People
Send emails directly to real people with each application. He noted that for most small companies or C-level executives, the email format is usually `firstName@Company.com`. For larger companies, ti may be `firstname.lastname@company.com`. To verify emails, he used [LinkedIn Rapportive](https://rapportive.com/) which connects an email address to the person's LinkedIn profile, and it can be added to GMail.

Initially, he applied to companies through sites like Indeeded.com, AngelList, LinkedIn, StackOverflow, Hacker News, company websites and even Craigslist. He'd submit a resume for any role that wanted React, Node or JavaScript experience. His yield was very low. Less than 5% of companies responded. When he switched to direct emails, the response rate improved to 22%.

### Start Small and Work Your Way Up
He grades interviews on some kind of nine-level scale. Level 1 interviews are with non-tech companies that need any developer. The interviewers at these companies ask nothing more than trivial tech questions. Level 9 interviews are those where interviewers ask difficult data structure and algorithm questions.

Set up your process so lower-level interviews are early and you face higher level interviews later on. Applying to companies in this order will help you gain experience with interviewing, build confidence and secure offers from companies with less intensive interviews. He used the experience with lower-level interviews to help himself complete interviews at companies with higher hiring bars.

Over the three months (just 12 weeks) he had offers starting around the three-week point, which he must have turned down. He turned down offers between $60K and nearly $90K in the first 6 weeks. Even in weeks 9 and 10 he had six-figure offers. It appears it wasn't until week 12, where he had three offers of $60K, somewhere just north of $120K and one of $125K where he accepted one.

### Study Like Your Future Job Depends on It
His 12 week coding bootcamp left him weak in data structures and algorithms (what on Earth did they teach?). To overcome this ridiculous hole (canyon of ignorance) in his education, he devoted entire days to study sorting algorithms or learning how the internet worked. He would watch YouTub videos, or search StackOverflow to learn concepts he didn't understand.

He also studied how to interview and answer interview questions. His resources were:

- [InterviewCake](https://www.interviewcake.com/) is a resource for data structures and algorithms. It breaks down solutions into step-by-step chunks. He notes that it is a great alternative to Cracking the Code Interview (CTCI).
- [HiredInTech's System Design Section](https://www.hiredintech.com/classrooms/system-design/lesson/60) is a great guide for system design interview questions.
- [Coderust](https://www.educative.io/collection/5642554087309312/5679846214598656). Coderust 2.0 costs $49 and gives you solutions to a variety of programming problems in several programming languages.
- [Reddit's How to Prepare for Tech Interviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1jov24/heres_how_to_prepare_for_tech_interviews/) is a good source of interview questions against which you can test yourself.
- [Front End Interview Questions](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions). This site has "an _exhaustive_ list of front-end question."
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/). Has lots of algorithm and data structure questions. You can filter by company, so for example, you could get all the questions that Uber or Google typically ask.

### Sell Yourself
Disgustingly, Hack Reactor trained their student to mask their inexperience. In their personal narratives, they purposely omit their bootcamp education. No wonder interviewing has become so difficult.

On the bright side, he used enthusiasm and a love for programming to sell himself. He also focused on what he built with React and Node. In other words, it greatly helps to have actual projects you can show off.

Also, he used the interviews as an opportunity to evaluate the company. He asked questions like

- What are some technical challenges you've recently faced?
- What do you enjoy about working at X company?
- How are teams structured and how are tasks usually defined?

### It's a Marathon, Not a Sprint
He worked six days a week. Aspects of a typical day included:

- Possibly an onsite interview
- Morning: breakfast and submit 5 applications
- Afternoon: lunch and study data structures, system design or JavaScript
- Evening: dinner and if there's a coding challenge do it, otherwise study more.
- End of day: exercise and sleep.

Some days, he'd study with friends. Others, he'd find a cafe and study alone or hang out at the Hack Reactor's alumni lounge. Each week he'd check in with his career councelor to talk about his progress.

He found that spending time with friends going through the same experience, and eating, sleeping and exercising helped manage the stress.

## Characteristics of an Expert Software Developer
1. What Characterizes a Software Development Expert?
    - Knowledge of the "Big O" notation - that is, knowing the relationship between the size of input data and the time and space requirements of various algorithms and data structures applied to that data; whether those algorithms and data structures perform in constant, linear, quadratic, exponential time and space, or by some other relation with respect to the size of the input data.
    - An ability to communicate ideas and approaches to solving problems.
2. The Three Most Important Tasks that a Software Development Expert Should be Good at.
    1. Breaking down large problems into smaller, more manageable ones.
    2. Writing code that can be reasoned about and tested independent of a particular application or service.
    3. Root-cause analysis; there are always bugs, so one must know how to root them out.
3. When Rating Your Own Java Programming Expertise, What Do You Consider?
    - [x] My contact time with Java (years/months)
    - [x] My professional experience with Java (as opposed to private projects)
    - [x] The depth of my Java knowledge (Java API, JVM, Java-specific pitfalls, etc.)
    - [ ] The breadth of my general programming knowledge (general object-oriented programming knowledge, other programming languages or paradigms, etc.)
    - [ ] The size of the Java projects I worked on.
    - [x] My performance in Java programming compared to other developers I know.
    - [ ] The amount of knowledge I have in other programming languages that is transferable to Java.
    - [ ] Other:
4. What Charater Traits or Behaviors Do You Think are Supportive for Becoming a Software Development Expert?
    - A love of solving puzzles and a passion for finding ways to make machines do something fun and interesting.
5. What should employers do in order to facilitate a continuous development of their employees' software development skills?
    - Provide funds for continuing education.
    - Subsidize or fully fund membership in professional societies, like the ACM or IEEE.
    - Organize a regular group event (with optional participation), or allow employees to organize such events where coworkers are encouraged to share something new they've learned. I've seen groups at different companies hold "Technical Thursday" lunch-time meetings, both with and without direct support from the company.
6. Do you regularly monitor your own software development activities (e.g. using software metrics or other statistics)? No, not regularly.
7. What is the most rewarding part of being a software developer for you? I get to collaborate with like-minded people who have a passion for creating new things.
8. DId you ever observe a significant decline of the programming performance of co-workers or yourself over time? Yes.
9. Is there a (former) colleague or teacher whom you would describe as your "mentor" in becoming a better software developer? Yes.
10. If you like to, you can describe how the decline of programming performance over time manifested itself and suggest possible reasons (e.g. changes in attitude, work environment, age-related decline of cognitive abilities): The decline I've witnessed has been due mostly to boredom from staying in the same job too long, and fear of losing one's job in companies that are in decline and laying off good developers and other engineers.
11. Could you briefly describe the "mentor" who assisted you in becoming a better software developer? He was deeply knowledgeable about the company's main product and always creating new features. However, he would always take the time to listen to thoughtful questions. His answers generally did not solve the problem, but would show a possible path to a solution. It made work much more interesting and satisfying. Also, when I showed him that the code was acting in a really unexpected way, he would take great interest in it and show me some of the steps he would take to narrow down the possible causes. I learned much more from him than from others who would might insist on a particular solution before either one of us was sure we understood the problem.
12. What do you perceive as the most challenging problem in your work as a software developer? What to focus on next. There are so many interesting things happening in the world that are driven by software, it makes it hard to choose sometimes. Of course, employers have a particular agenda, so that narrows down the choices for the work day. Outside of work, I like to explore aspects of software development and tools that aren't available to me otherwise.

## The Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition
You can rate yourself on various areas of expertise with this model.

1. Stage 1 (Novice):
    - has little or no experience
    - wants unambiguous rules to accomplish his/her tasks
    - is able to handle small, isolated tasks
2. Stage 2 (Advanced Beginner):
    - has gained some experience
    - can work more independently than a novice
    - knows general principles in a limited context, but does not have a holistic understanding ("big picture")
3. Stage 3 (Competent):
    - has a holistic understanding of the problem domain
    - bases his/her work on deliberate planning and extensive past experience
    - can apply general maxims (e.g. design patterns) easily to specific contexts
4. Stage 4 (Proficient):
    - has a vast amount of experience that he/she can intuitively apply to new contexts
    - can easily differentiate between irrelevant and important details
    - constantly reflects on what he/she has done and revises own approach to perform better in the future
5. Stage 5 (Expert):
    - he/she is a major source of knowledge and information for others
    - primarily works from his/her intuition

## How to Get Hired in Software in 5 Easy Steps
1. Start of Join a Project.
    - write code.
    - take advantage of the freedom you have to write the code you want.
2. Initiating a Creative Project.
    - Give a business idea a shot.
    - Think about existing products that you'd like to make "such less" and just go for it.
    - It's less about how well it works and more about what you learn in the process.
    - Internet of Things (IoT): look into the [Beaglebone Black](http://beagleboard.org/BLACK) for $55. The motherboard fits into an Altoids case. It runs Andriod, Debian, Ubuntu and others.
    - Listen to others talk about app ideas and go create them. Again, it's not about success or failure. You're looking for a focused purpose that let's you explore some aspect of computger science for it's learning experience.
    - Fix a terrible app.
        - Write a time tracker
        - Create a catalog for your favorite collectibles
    - Use one of the many APIs with tons of data behind them. Take a look at [ProgrammanbleWeb](http://www.programmableweb.com/) to see some of the APIs available and come up with ideas of what you can do with all that data.
3. When You Can't Beat 'Em, Join 'Em! Join an open source project that is looking for a developer.
    - Content Management Systems like Drupal or Wordpress have lots of open source modules that are in desparate need of your coding skills.
    - Join [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) for 3D work. They even have [a page to help new developers get started](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:Doc/New_Developer_Info)
    - Find a Linux kernel driver that is getting a lot of complaints online, or a device you own yourself that's having issues. The [Linux kernel mailing list](http://www.tux.org/lkml/) is a very helpful place if you listen for a while first and leran how to ask a question.
4. Line Up the Resources.
    - Web Developers - setup an Amazon EC2 cloud instance under the [free tier](http://aws.amazon.com/free/), or find a cheap hostin solution ([DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) is a good place).
    - IoT: The [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) for $35 is another option that may be easier than the [Beaglebone](http://beagleboard.org/BLACK). The coding language is simpler and there are lots of hardware extensions that will let you experiment. Search the Internet for ideas and recreate them.
    - Host your code on a place like [GitHub](https://github.com).
5. Don't Wait!
    - Setup a profile on [oDesk](https://www.odesk.com/), [Elance](https://www.elance.com/) or one of the other software freelance sites. It will take some work to setup a profile, but show future employers that you have initiative.
    - Read topics on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). There are some brilliant people who are active on that site and you can learn a lot of insight about your language, or platform just by reading the questions and answers of others.
