My very first goal is to secure my financial future so I never have to go through another long period out of work with no income.
<!--more-->

I have several projects I want to work on. The first priority is protecting my financial future. I never again want to go through an extended period with just unemployment benefits for income. It is wholly insufficient. I believe the [backup service]({% post_url /projects/2016-09-05-0733-data-backup-service %}) is the best option I have to make something that will bring in extra income. I plan to turn it into a [side business]({% post_url /notes/2016-04-08-riverhom-data-cloud-project %}).

## Activities in Support of My Goals

There are a lot of other things I still need to work out as far as getting my priorities in order. Here's a short list, not in any particular order, of some of the things I think I need to do this year and next.

- Continue to learn how write software that will index and be alerted to updates of the NTFS Master File Table (MFT). This is in support of the [backup service business]({% post_url /notes/2016-04-08-riverhom-data-cloud-project %}).
- Make daily practice of Kempo, as I have invested a lot of time in this skill. I have good friends and want to maintain these friendships through sharing and learning martial arts.
- Practice using Krita to make 2D art. I want an art outlet, and eventually I'd like to make a game with a steampunk/biopunk setting. I'll use Krita to sketch and develop 2D art assets.
- Work on Blender 3D. This is in support of the steampunk game. I'll use Blender 3D as another art outlet and to make 3D game assets.
- Filing and Finances each weekend. This is just essential. I have to get the ever mounting amount of paper clutter under control, and I have manage my financial house a whole lot better than I currently do.
- Try to get some algorithm practice in weekly. This is just to keep up my programming and software-design skills, much like practicing Kempo or drawing and modeling in Krita and Blender 3D.
- Use Vagrant to spin up a Linux VM and install LedgerSMB to manage your budget.
