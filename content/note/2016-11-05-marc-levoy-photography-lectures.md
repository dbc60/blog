Notes from [Lectures on Digital Photography](https://sites.google.com/site/marclevoylectures/home), by Marc Levoy.

## Lecture 1

The depth of field equation is:

$$DoF = \frac{2NCU^2}{F^2}$$

where $$N$$ is the _F_ number, $$C$$ is the Circle of Confusion, $$U$$ is the distance to the subject, and $$F$$ is the focal length. Details to follow during the course.

We'll talk about:

- Sensor noise
- Dark Current noise
- Color Theory (Red-Green-Yellow, Red-Blue-Yellow, Cyan-Magenta-Yellow)
- Photography
- Choosing a Camera

and lots of other stuff. See if you can find the syllabus.

Readings: London, Ch. 2 (Camera) & 13 (History).

### Laws of Perspective

Rules:
- Light travels in a straight line
- Light converges at the eye

Natural Perspective vs Linear Perspective. See the handout on [image formation][1]. To open the slides in a new window, click <a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/Marc Levoy Course/Week01/image-formation-23mar16.key.pdf" target="_blank">this link</a>.

- A "full frame" Canon 5D Mark III has a sensor size of 24mm x 36mm.
- Nikon D5100 has a sensor size  of APS-C (15.7 mm x 23.6mm) and a crop factor of $$1.5x$$ ($$36/23.67$$ is approximately $$1.5$$).
- Nexus 6P has a sensor size of 4.5mm x 6.2mm, which gives it a crop factor of $$6x$$.

Longest Exposure Time. On average, humans can hand-hold down to $$1/60$$ second. There is a _rule of thumb_ that the longest exposure is $$1/f$$, where $$f$$ is the 35mm equivalent focal length. So, if you have a 90mm lense on a camera with a crop factor of $$2x$$, then $$1/180$$ second is the longest exposure you should use while hand-holding the camera.

For my Nikon DX 18-55mm lense, and D5100 camera (with a crop factor of $$1.5x$$), the longest hand-held exposure I can manage is as long as $$1/(18 x 1.5)$$ = $$1/27$$ second, down to $$1/(55 x 1.5) = 1/82.5$$ second. Around these values it has settings for 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80 and 100. I might be able to get away with 25 and 80, but I should probably stick to a range of 30 to 100, depending on the zoom. The more the zoom, the shorter my maximum exposure time is to avoid bluring the picture with my hand.

### Assignment 1

[Taking 'bad' photos](https://sites.google.com/site/marclevoylectures/assignments/assign1-bad-photos). The camera in automatic mode will try to take care of the technical aspects of photography for you, and just let you frame the scene and shoot. The goal of this assignment is to produce photographs that the camera might consider "bad" in some way, but are nonetheless interesting to look at, and even artistic.

There are five different requirements. Try to take photos such that each meets a different requirement. A photo may meet more than one requirement, but you should be able to label it as exemplifying a particular requirement.

1. At least one photo must be poorly exposed. That is, most of the image should be either very close to black (underexposed) or close to fat white due to oversaturation (overexposed).
1. The main subject of at least one photograph should be motion-blurred, either due to movement of the subject or movement of the camera.
1. In at least one photo, nothing at all should be in focus. It's hard to take a good looking photo where nothing is in focus - be creative!
1. You should use the wrong white balance setting for some intentional effect in at least one photo. The white balance setting on a camera, tells the camera what color it should expect the scene illumination to be. For example, daylight (which is bluish) or indoor incandescent (which is reddish). Most cameras have an "auto white balance (AWB)" setting, and manual settings for these other illumination types. You don't need to understand white balance in detail to fulfill this requirement.
1. At least one photo should be poorly composed. Scan through Chapter 12 of the London textbook if you've bought it, and search on Google for "rules of composition". Read about them, and then intentionally break a few. If you're not sure what to do, you may want to consider an exactly centered subject that produces an oddly symmetric photo, a confusion between the subject and a background object, or a horizon that isn't level.
