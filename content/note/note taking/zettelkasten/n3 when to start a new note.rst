When to Start a New Note
########################

Say you're starting a fresh Zettelkasten, or you learn more about an existing topic. You write your note and expand the text. You get to a point where you ask yourself, should I create a new Zettel? Should I split up this one? Can I attach detail there?

It's easy to answer these questions, as the scenarios are limited.

If you have no notes yet, then start with anything you feel fits into a note right now. You'll learn when to split notes, with time.

If you already have notes, search your archive for similar notes or topics. What you do next depends on the outcome. One outcome is that you have no notes related to the topic. In this case, create a new Zettel as if your Zettelkasten were empty. Your search revealed it won't affect the existing notes anyway.

On the other hand, if you have notes related to the topic, you should skim or read those notes to figure out how your new information fits. In this case, you'll have to remember to create links between the existing notes and the new information. Regardless of the links, you'll find one of three possible cases apply. The first possibility is that the existing notes don't fit the new idea. In this case, create a new note, but adhere to existing keywords. That is, put it in a sequence that represents the given topic.

In the next possibility, you find a few notes roughly match the new information. Maybe your new thought doesn't warrant its own Zettel now, so create a new note to compile the existing knowledge (a compilation note), comment the compilation and make sure to add the new detail, and create links in both directions.

Finally, one note is about the exact same topic. If it contains everything, then you're done. If you found something new, such as a new reference, citattion or other detail, then incorporate the new information into the existing note.
