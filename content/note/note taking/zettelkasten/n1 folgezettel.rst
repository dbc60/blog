The Term Folgezettel
####################

A Folgezettel is a note sequence. It refers to the fact that Luhmann's cards are kept physically in sequence, and those containing a single thought are labeled as ``12/3b/1``, ``12/3b/2``, ``12/3b/3``, and so on. It initially seemed to me that the physical placement of cards and the sequence of labels were needed to keep together one thought that didn't fit on a single card.

Sascha's Take on Folgezettel
****************************

One person, Sascha, writes in `No, Luhmann was not about Folgezettel <http://zettelkasten.de/posts/luhmann-folgezettel-truth/>`_ that he and his friend Christian used to translate Folgezettel as "sequence of notes", but now he says to think of Folgezettel as "a child to his parent note."

Sascha claims that another person, Daniel, who created a program called `Zkn3 <http://zettelkasten.danielluedecke.de/en/index.php>`_ to implement Zettelkasten on a computer, is that Folgezettel is the main concept behind Luhmann's Zettelkasten:

    This means that you develop an idea in a linear way and branch off if the next thought doesn't fit into the prevous string of ideas.

Sascha notes that one Zettel can directly reference another, so the physical position of each Zettel is not so important. It seems to me the labels and the fact that they represent the physical position of each Zettel are important for locating each Zettel in a physical Zettelkasten. Also, if Zettels are stored in separate files, you'll need an indexing system to reference and locate Zettels.

Sascha says that Folgezettel (the specific and intended connection between Zettel, realized through their position in the archive) can have more than one purpose:

* continue a thought
* continue an idea to a thought
* exclude a thought from the existing line of thoughts (Folgezettel could mark a blind end - that is, what conclusion to *not* make).

He notes that the intent of a Folgezettel is not always clear and because we don't have a physical Zettelkasten, he concludes there is no good reason for Folgezettel. A Folgezettel can be replaced by a link with an annotation added to convey its intent. He goes on to say that instead of using Folgezettel, one can use tags on Zettels indicating to which categories they belong.

Sascha's annotated links are realized as follows. He prefixes the ID of a Zettel with a "ยง" to indicate a (parent) link to that Zettel. If he wants to see all the children of a particular note (as if they were part of a Folgezettel), he searches for its ID with a "ยง" prefix. If he wants a Zettel to be an addition or a continuation of a Zettel, he links to it and marks the new Zettel as a continuation.

Daniel's Take on Folgezettel
****************************

Daniel responded to `Sascha's post <http://zettelkasten.de/posts/luhmann-folgezettel-truth/>`_ in his post titled `You Underestimate the Power of the Dark Folgezettle <https://strengejacke.wordpress.com/2015/11/01/you-underestimate-the-power-of-the-dark-folgezettel/>`_. He says that Sascha overlooked to aspects of Folgezettel:

#. A Folgezettel or note sequence was not primarily used by Luhmann due to the physical limitations of small paper notes. Writing very short notes is a technique itself.
#. A manual link or reference between two notes is something different than continuing an idea via Folgezettel (note sequences).

Links or references do not emphasize the relationship between notes (ideas, concepts). The context of connections usually remains unclear due to arbitrary relationships. Fogezettel, however, create specific relationships - adding manual links (references) to these relationships create relationships of relationships, the core aspect of Luhmann's working principle.

Daniel goes on to say that all notes in a note sequence are on the same level. They do not represent a parent-child relationship of thoughts. Also, there are no categories. There is a :ref:`keyword register <keyword-register>`) which is functionally equivalent to categories, but more powerful and allows multiple storage. It defines certain notes as thematic "entrances" into the Zettelkasten. That's cool.

My Take on Folgezettel
######################

For :doc:`an electronic zettelkasten <n2 an electronic zettelkasten>`, I think note sequences can best be handled by creating a note (Zettel) that merely contains a sequence of references to other notes. That note will be included in the :doc:`index <index>`. See :doc:`Zettelkasten <index>` for more information about Zettelkasten. On the other hand, if a note is self-contained, it too will be in the :doc:`index <index>`, but it will just contain content on the subject of its title.
