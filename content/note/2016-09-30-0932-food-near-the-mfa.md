Here's a list of places to eat near the MFA. This is a list from Ryan Plessner. It's particularly good for places near the MFA on a Red Sox game night. He says, "most places in Fenway are actually pretty open by 7:10. But otherwise, I'd say either restaurants at the prudential or Audubon circle."

- At Northeastern there's Symphony Sushi, Ginger Exchange and if you want to eat with your hands Lucy’s Cafe. These are probably the closest to MFA
- In Fenway: Sweet Cheeks and Tasty Burger are probably the best bets for getting seated. Tapestry will be empty, because it is always empty, but that’s because its incredibly overpriced and not good
- Audubon circle has Audubon (which has pretty good food although it is primarily a bar). Theres also a good japanese bbq and sichuan
- Pru has a bunch of stuff like 5 napkins and Wagamama

## Parking

As for parking, its always overpriced in fenway and I think you need a parking pass to park at Northeastern. There’s a church at 105 Jeresy St. that does $30 parking on game days, but they only have like 15 spaces.

John Logan says: I would recommend parking on Bay State Road. It runs parallel to Comm Ave between Kenmore and St Mary’s St. If that is full, I usually try St Mary’s St and then Beacon St once you are in Brookline. It is an easy loop to maximize the number of meter spaces you pass that are easy to park in.
