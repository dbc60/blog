This site has captured my interest. It describes itself as:

> The present structure is planned around an eight day course, delivered two days a week for four weeks. Each chapter corresponds to the course notes for one day's material. The eighth day should be free discussion, so no prepared notes, meaning that there are seven chapters. We've deliberately made each chapter a single HTML page because it makes it much easier to print the text.
