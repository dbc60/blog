excerpt: I have a Logitech G710+ with Cherry MX Brown switches and o-rings. It is a good keyboard. I need another keyboard for work. Should I stick with the Browns, try another switch with tactile feedback (Clear or Green) or go with a linear key (Red or Black, perhaps)?

## Learning about Cherry MX Switches
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Once upon a time, they lived happily ever after.

The keys have a good feel. My G710+ has Cherry MX Brown key switches with o-rings on the key caps. The o-rings are supposed to suppress some of the noise. It's a reasonably quiet keyboard and the feel is pretty good. Still, I'd like to try a keyboard with Cherry MX Red switches. I don't think I want o-rings.
