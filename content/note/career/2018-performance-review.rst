Objectives and Key Results
**************************

From `Google's OKR Introduction <google okr intro_>`_:

OKRs at a glance:

* Objectives are ambitious and may feel somewhat uncomfortable
* Key results are measurable and should be easy to grade with a number (Google uses a scale of 0 – 1.0)
* OKRs are public so that everyone in the organization can see what others are working on
* The “sweet spot” for an OKR grade is 60% – 70%; if someone consistently fully attains their objectives, their OKRs aren’t ambitious enough and they need to think bigger
* Low grades should be viewed as data to help refine the next OKRs
* OKRs are not synonymous with employee evaluations
* OKRs are not a shared to-do list

Summary
*******

I had a good performance review with Coop today. It was more like a performance summary and planning for the rest of 2019, because the review has already been finalized.

I have a lot of notes in my Bullet journal I need to summarize here. I need to be sure to track goals and objectives. Coop is going to type up his notes, which amounts to about a dozen items. My job will be to whittle that down to 3-5 items to accomplish for the rest of the year.
