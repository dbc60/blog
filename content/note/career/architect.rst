An architect is responsible for driving the evolution of the technical
structure, organization, conceptual integrity of the platform, product
architecture of a major platform sub‐system and the high level design of the
key modules that comprise it.

The role works with other architects, technical
leads and other senior engineering personnel to define, refine, revise and
guide the architecture, system design, development paths/tools, and
integration planning required for software development initiatives. The role
also works collaboratively with development team(s) to help them maintain high
levels of productivity and quality.

Principal Responsibilities
**************************

* Works closely with other architects As a group, the architects contribute input and expertise on all architecture discussions in order to solve complex inter‐microservice and inter‐product design problems; ensures that microsystem architecture evolves in sync with system level vision
* Participates in technology strategy decisions including what modules should be built and what should be bought
* Supports education and mentoring of developers in architectural standards and tools, and in the creation of high‐quality architectural and design documentation
* Interacts with key engineers, engineering management team, customers, partners, and suppliers, often involving complex and controversial situations including influencing and persuading others
* Takes a leadership role in requirements analysis, and define, refines, revises and guides the architecture, system design, development paths/tools, and integration planning required for multiple significant software modules; often acts as a technical lead working on complex projects and issues where analysis of situations or data requires both broad and in‐depth evaluation of variable factors; provides advice and input in determining feasibility of proposed projects and the overall plan for implementation
* Works closely with project tech leads to ensure that architecturally significant changes within their projects are rigorously analyzed, designed and reviewed
* Owns and maintains the key subsystem level architectural documentation of platform and products; keeps them updated and available to engineering teams
* Maintains the processes, methodologies and tools used to analyze and design system architecture at Threat Stack
* Participates in developing the subsystem architecture with other architects  and project level interactions with tech leads and other engineering personnel
* Participates in planning the evolution of the subsystem architecture in keeping with the overall platform strategy
* Keeps technically abreast of new and emerging technologies in area of specialization; supports learning, adoption and implementation of new technologies that will provide a technical advantage to Threat Stack products in the marketplace
* Actively pursues and leads others in acquiring information and training regarding trends and advancements for mission critical technologies, and identifies opportunities for others to incorporate acquired skills and knowledge where applicable
* Monitors and represents the company in applicable industry technology groups, and standards activities and bodies as required; attends technical conferences as appropriate and shares acquired knowledge and insights with others
* May interface with potential technology suppliers and partners, taking the lead in technology evaluations and making recommendations regarding integration into our products
* Identifies any needs for and recommend technology research projects. Brainstorming technical solutions to problems arising from other groups outside engineering and product. E.g. sales churn, engagement...
* Works closely with other engineering team members and departments (Product, QA, Ops) on technical matters and may interact with vendors or customers on technical information or modifications related to system design, development, and research projects
* Performs risk analysis for new and evolving products by identifying and classifying critical information and business assets, the security stakeholders, security properties of the assets that the stakeholders will rely upon; develops realistic threat models to inform the design and development of mitigating controls and provide security sub‐system design and development consultation on critical communications security, identity and access control, and security monitoring/analysis components
* Acts as technical lead in projects whose primary purpose is architecture development or realignment
* Works with technical leads and project teams to ensure that system level design is consistent and coordinated with system level architecture, and that it is coordinated across projects; proposes and/or reviews any new technologies to be used in the subsystem for assigned product line
* Participates in assigned subsystem platform and product level design reviews
* Follows progress by teams on the architecture vision, and escalates when we are not evolving fast enough
* Promote and champion self-discovery and prototyping by other engineers, leads or architects
