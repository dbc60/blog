What do you migrate into a new notebook?
<!--more-->

The short answer is only what still matters. Use December to close "open loops" -- tasks that keep nagging you or have become stagnant. There are two ways to do this: complete the task, or just get rid of it entirely. If you have a lot of open tasks related to a specific project, it's time to take a step back and see if the project is worth it. Ask yourself things like, "will it make you, or those you love happy? Do you really want to read every book on your reading list?"

When transferring to a new notebook, look not only to the content, but to the methods as well. The Bullet Journal, for example, is very different today from what it was five years ago. Maybe some of your methods need to change. On the other hand, maybe you've found them reliable and even enjoyable.

Migrate collections to the new book first. Rather than migrating every item, Kim Alvarex recently suggested a modified form of "Threading" that allows you to reference collections in old notebooks. To do this, simply number your old notebooks. Then, when you want to reference an old collection in your new notebook, write down the old notebook's number followed by the page number of the collection. For example "7.125" would mean you're referencing a collection in you're 7th Bullet Journal on the 125th page.

Once collections are settled, set up January's monthly log and add any lingering tasks from the previous year. Finally, write the start and completion dates on the fore-edge of the old notebook. It's the final act before it's added to your library of old notebooks.

One tip: always simplify. Figure out ways to be less busy so that you can be more productive. Do what works for you.

Summary
- use December as a productivity sprint. Close loops. Weed out your lists.
- Scope out your next journal so it will be ready January 1st.
- January 1st: Review and study your old notebook. What worked and what didn't. In both cases, ask yourself "why?"
- If you have a hardcover notebook, break it in.
- Transfer edited lists and collections. Migrate only what still matters.
- Set up your January monthly log.
- Label your old notebook and put it in your library.

## Bullet Journal Key
- Bullets
    - $\cdot$ for tasks.
    - $\circ$ for events.
    - $-$ for notes.
    - $X$ for completed tasks.
    - $>$ for tasks migrated to the next monthly log.
    - $<$ for tasks that are due for a while, so they've been migrated to the Future Log.
- Signifiers
    - $*$ use $*$ for important tasks, events, or notes.
    - $!$ for inspiration
    - $?$ for explore

### Future Log: The Alastair Method
One of the difficulties with the Bullet Journal system is listing or planning future events. Without writing out a full year diary, it's difficult to add events in a separate container that is also easily updatable and quick to read.

[Alastair](http://bulletjournal.com/future-log-the-alastair-method/) came up with his own solution. He creates a wide margin on the left of the page and writes a series of columns for each month on the left. For example, he might choose the next six months and label the columns AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC, JAN, with a heading of 2015 across the top.

To the right of the margin line, he writes in each future event with its exact date and then puts a dot in the column that represents the month. It doesn't matter if the events are added chronologically or not.

When it's time to move these to your monthly planner page, all that's required is to quickly scan down the column of the month, locate the dots to signify entries for that month, then migrate the actual tasks to their dates in the monthly list.

Some people suggested using one column in the margin and write the number of the month on each line there, and the event on the right. That sounds like it's more difficult to find the events for a particular month.

I think it might be better to have two pages in a Future Log section. The first page has months FEB through JUL and the second has AUG through JAN of the following year.

[Another person](http://bulletjournal.com/future-log-the-alastair-method/#comments) did a full page split into two columns. The left column has one column for each month of the next year, and the right is labelled "2016 Outlook" (it was in her 2015 notebook). Each line is an event with a date or range of dates, like "Westercon: July 1-4 (Portland)".

### Collections
Collections are for related tasks and notes. To create a collection, open your notebook to the next empty spread. Give it a topic and number the pages. Next, migrate all the notes and tasks into that collection. Add the collection to the index for reference later.

Collections can be things like
- Books to read.
- Shopping.
- Wish list.
- Gifts for Adelle (things she would like for her birthday or a holiday).
- Movies to see or rent.

Collections are a great way to organize shopping lists, projects or ongoing classes.

### Threading
Using Collections in the Bullet Journal is a great way to organize ongoing projects. Some longer-lived projects will spread throughout your book. Though indexing helps you keep track of where your collections occur within the book, it can be a hassle to keep referring to your Index. That's where Threading comes in.

Let's say you have a collection that lives on pages 2-6 then reappears on page 14-21, and then again on pages 45-62. To "thread" this collection, simply add the page number of the previous or next instance of that collection next to the current page number. That way, when you're working on this collection, you don't have to refer the Index anymore.

### Other Tools
There's a graph called a [spiraldex](http://kentfromoz.blogspot.com/2013/05/introducing-spiraldex-visual-mapping.html) used to track whatever you want over the course of 18 hours each day. You can color code the spiral to record different things. She used green for productivity, blue for physical activity and red for chronic pain.

There's another tool called a chronoindex. It might be similar to the spiraldex. I'll have to look it up.

    1. Use a Plain Text Editor to Hold To-Dos
    2. Use a Desktop Folder for Each New Task. If you try to keep your desktop clean, then this method helps you focus on what you need to do.
    3. Write Your List in Markdown and put it on GitHub (which [supports task lists](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments)), or use the [Draft App](https://draftin.com/) which has [many features](http://docs.withdraft.com/) to support writing.
    4. Use a spreadsheet. Bernie Mchalik creates [a spreadsheet a week](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/BernieMichalik/entry/my_new_favorite_todo_list_manager_a_spreadsheet?lang=en).
    5. Create a Hipster PDA with a Stack of Note Cards
    6. Limit Your Day's To-Do List with Post-It Notes
    7. Follow a New Notebook Method
