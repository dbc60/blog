## Design Summary
This section, also called the *treatment* describes what makes your game unique and fun. Focus on high-level features and gameplay elments. Resist the temptation to get too detailed or implmentation-specific. You are trying to describe your game's *Unique Selling Point* (USP) in as few words as possible. The USP is what makes the game stand out -- what makes it different from al the other available games.

- What excites you about your game idea?
- What do you think will excite the game's players?
- Include a note on the target platform. Will it be:
  - PC
  - Mac
  - Consoles
  - tablet or other handheld device
  - Phone (iPhone, Android, Windows Phone)
- Can it be played solo, or does it need to connect to other players?
- What advantages does the target platform provide that you hope to exploit?

What follows is an example design summary that has an overview, an elevator pitch, a storyboard and a list of what makes the game unique. The elevator pitch is worded to deliberately sound like a marketing brochure. The storyboard is a detailed, blow-by-blow descriptoin of the gamer's experience - what it is like to join the game and participate in a match. Finally, the USP describes what makes the game different from similar games

### Paintball Net Overview
*Paintball Net* is a multiplayer paintball game. Players, competing individually or in teams, navigate through wide-open, outdoor landscapes and tight, indoor arenas, trying to splat their opponents before they themselves get splatted. Each player begins with basic 'free' equipment and a small budget. By competing in paintball matches, plaers earn additional money that they can use to upgrade their equipment. Players can join established teams, create their own team, or remain solo.

### Elevator Pitch
*Paintball Net* is paintball the way it *should* be! With a full arsenal of modern, sci-fi weapons and equipment --- from pistols to genades to rocket launchers to jetpacks to 'refracto' suits (think *Predator*) --- *Paintball Net* gives you the thrill of paintball like you've never know it -- and without the nasty welts and bruises!

- Play as part of a tem, or go solo.
- Charge through the brush in outdoor environments, or lurk in the shadows of cramped indoor arenas. Hunt down your friends and make them eat paint!

Everyone begins with the same free equipment and a small budget of cash. As you play, you earn additional cash to upgrade your equipment. But everyone also has the same limit on what they can carry, forcing your to decide what you will use in the next match. Should you carry that heavy rocket launcher or just stuff a few extra grenades in your pouch and stay light on your feet? Or should you strap on the jetpack and pick off your opponents from the air? Decisions, decisions ...

### Storyboard in Text
When the new player first logs in to *Paintball Net*, he has to create an account. This involves submitting name, gender, and address, plus a few other characteristics, such as skin tone and hair color. The new player will be created with 'freebie' equipment: camouflage trousers, dark T-shir, high-top shoes, protective face mask, and a free paintball gun. He will have a 'full load' of free paintballs (which, at the rate the free gun fires, should last for several matches).

Once the player has created his account, he must choose a paintball field to play on. The Field Manager lists all available *Paintball Net* fields and how many players are currently ...

### Paintball Net's Unique Selling Proposition
There are a lot of FPS games available, including some paintabll-themed mods of those games, and some with better technology driving them. What makes us think that *Paintball Net* will find a place among them?

Player progression against competition.
: Players learn the game while playing against each other in a well-balanced
  environment. All players have the same 'weight limit' for equipment carried,
  so even advanced players with better equipment must choose their weapons and
  equipment carefully.

Player persistence.
: All player information is tracked and mainatained. Whichever field a player
  plays on, his statistics and equipment are there waiting for him. Players can
  also customize their equipment to fit their own playing style.

Community emphasis.
: *Paintball Net* is designed to support a *real* sense of community. WIth
  full-featured chat in the Ready Room, players can interact (or not) and get
  to know each other. Also, *Paintball Net* supports global teams of players
  that play together.

Unique paintball equipment with a 'real' paintball feel.
: *Paintball Net* uses 3D technology to create unique and outlandish paintball
  equipment, such as 'refracto suits' and 'jetpacks,' while preserving the
  thrill of real paintball. And unlike a lot of paintball mods based on
  'deathmatch' games, *Paintball Net* uses a single-hit match elimination model
  --- no endless 'respawning' of players.

### Storyboard in Pictures
You might also want to include a more traditional storyboard section in your
design summary. It can be a collection of screenshot mock-ups that show the
game as it might be played, with accompanying descriptions of what is happening
in each scene.
