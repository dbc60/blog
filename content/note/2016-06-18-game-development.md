## The 100:10:1 Method

These notes are from [The 100:10:1 Method](https://nickbentleygames.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/the-100-10-1-method-for-game-design/) by Nick Bentley. His method is only three steps long.

1. Quickly write down 100 short game concepts in a notebook, and do it in less than a week. It can even be done in one day. This sounds like brainstorming. The idea is to include whatever comes to mind without judging it. The ideas can, in retrospect, be dumb, incomplete and completely impossible to realize. He keeps writing down ideas even after he feels "spent".

2. Based on some selection criteria (which depend on his design goals), he picks 10 of the 100 concepts and tries to turn them into actual games. Just crude working versions. He works on **all in parallel**. This step usually takes six to twelve months.

3. He picks the most promising game of the 10 he developed. He then play-tests and polishes it until he's sure he can't improve it. He then makes a list of its weaknesses and improves it more. At this point, he's done. The time he spends in this step depends on how much patience he has in pursuit of perfection, the type of game involved and how close he got to the mark in step 2.

Here's a list of three games he developed with this method and the time spent in Step 3:

* Cat Herders: 1 year.
* Stinkers: 3 years.
* Catchup: 4 years.

### Focus on Process Not Outcome

* Don't pursue the rewards directly, trust that they will come. Focus on the process with diligence and effortful study, and let the outcome take care of itself.
* Stop worrying about what others will think of your performance.
* View each attempt as merely practice for the next attempt.
* Choose for yourself how to rate your performance. Rate yourself based on the effort, not the outcome. Don't try to win today, try to become a winner. Be happier when your best effort results in defeat than when a weak effort results in victory. Determine what your best effort would look like, and then make it happen.
* Bring awareness to your performance, either during or immediately after it, so you can learn to identify when bad results follow good processes, and vice-versa. With practice you will build the confidence needed to avoid second-guessing yourself when the results are bad but your technique is good.

### Selection Criteria

Initially, Nick Bentley chose game designs based on what is interesting to him. He enjoyed designing that way, but it failed to produce games with broad interest. He now designs games with a commercial intent, so he's changed his selection criteria.

One of his key criterion is still "what's interesting to me", but he also has a set of criteria that have to do with what buyers will want from his game. This set requires he develop a clear picture of for whom he's designing. For example, when he wants to [design games for casual players](https://nickbentleygames.wordpress.com/2013/09/30/board-game-publishers-are-doing-it-wrong/) he selects concepts with qualities casual gamers tend to like: simple, straightforward, intuitive rules, not too competitive-feeling, components at a reasonable price, etc.

By including audience-related criteria, it helps him to better appreciate game dynamics with which he's not already good with, and make him a more sophisticated designer in general. For example, he enjoys competitive, interactive games. In designing other kinds of games, he's come to see the artistry of a well-done, non-competitive design, and further, he now knows better how and has more tools at his disposal, _adjust competitive feel_.

### Play Testing

Nick Bentley uses rules-of-thumb about what others want for audience-related selection criteria. He doesn't really know what they want, though. To learn what buyers _really_ want, he plays prototypes with people in his target group and learns from their feedback. He says, "The magic of great games is an emergent property of all their aspects combined, and it's not captured by descriptions of their separate parts. Therefore playtesting must be the ultimate arbiter, and I rely heavily on it starting at the end of step 2, and for all of step 3 of my process."

## Assumptions

- Risk: the same people play together most of the time. Someone can not show up one time, and a different player can join from the usual group occasionally and it's still playable.

## Philosophy on Balancing a Game

A game designer need only design 80% or so of the game, and try to make sure the game starts balanced. The players complete the remaining 20% of the game through their experience while playing it.

## Permanent Changes

When there's a point in the game that will result in a permanent change (such as destroying a city), put the control for that decision in the hands of the players. Rob Daviau designed Risk: Legacy. He considered the rule, when you roll three sixes a city gets nuked. Neither he nor the players had control over when that could happen. If the first is roll is three sixes, that destroys part of the board before the players have even started. No fun.

He found it was much better to put that kind of decision in the players' hands. They players get cards. It has a sticker on it. They players choose when to play it; if to play it; and where to play it. This puts players in charge of short and long-term decision-making. They decide if, when and where to place the stickers. There are also other kinds of stickers that change the dynamics of the game.

Other permanent changes depend on the results of previous games. For example, if you win one game, you get a bonus for all future games. This also makes you a greater target for your opponents. It works well in Risk, and it might work well in other games, too.

## Gimmicks without a Point

Just doing things without an effect on the game is pointless. Here are a few examples of player activities that are pointless when they have no effect on the outcome of the game:

* Recording winners
* Naming continents
* Naming cities

On the other hand, when these actions do effect the game, it becomes interesting and possibly fun:

* Recording winners. Winners get certain bonuses. They might get a missile for each time they've won. It reminds the players that previous winners are more powerful and should be taken down. The players are motivated to balance the game (rather than requiring the game designer to ensure the game continues to stay balanced).
* If naming a continent gives you a +1 when you own it, you now have a reason to name it and you can pick your favorite spot. It also gives other players a reason to blow it up, because they know you like it.
* By naming a city, if you win and own the city, only **you** can start there in future games.

## Changes to Legacy Games

Too many small changes led to chaos. It's better to have a few large changes and dole them out. For example, in Risk Legacy, there were too many kinds of stickers. People would ruin their own games by trying to apply them all at once.

Daviau kept the stickers, but made a rule change to dole them out gently so people could learn how and when to use each one. For example, they don't get to open the first pack until one person gets to sign the board for a second time. Players can't open the next pack until they have eliminated a faction from the game (which presumably takes several games). They get to open the third pack when they've discovered all 9 minor cities.

I like this idea of gradually introducing rules. Players can start with a few sentences that tell them the basic rules. As they play, the earn the right to get more rules that make the game more complicated and interesting. For example, there are no rules that make permanent changes to the game in the early stages. It is, at least a partial, workaround for enabling people to start playing quickly without having to assimilate several paragraphs of complicated rules.

Good things that happened:

* Using a "solved" game like Risk.
* Players don't own factions.
* Unpredictability (not chaos) with unlocks
* Introducing a draft
* Pulling from non-games: cliff hangers. This is related to the game packets, which create new rules. People actually looked forward to opening them and learning how to use them instead of "Oh no. We have to learn more rules."
* Gimmicks - "Do not open. Ever". Resulted in a meta-game. The contents of the envelope is one of 4 possible bad things. Some people decide as a group to open it anyways and take responsibility for the outcome (or not - some just want to see what's inside).
* Unboxing the game. Breaking the seals on the envelopes. Destroying certain cards along the way. Drawing on the board. It makes it impossible to reset the game to its unboxed condition.

## Brainstormed Game Concepts

1. Railworld - build railroads. Gain points by covering territory, enhancing economies through increased trade. The railroads shuttle people and goods enabling other industries and commerce in general.
1. Go (the game), Chess or other old board games on servers. Hold tournaments, track progress, keep a leader board.
1. Steampunk-based game. Here are some terms to excite the imagination

## Railroads Win
I've thought of a game world where the car never takes off, but rail is the preferred means of transportation. What would it be like if all cities and towns were connected by rail? There are no cars or buses in general use. Transportation is purely by light rail for local travel and heavy rail for long distance and transportation of cargo over land. Ships are necessary for long distances over water, whether it be down a river like the Mississippi, or across lakes, seas and oceans. Other than that, transportation is either on foot, bicycle or rail. If set late enough, then small planes are available for air travel.

I see a steampunk world of railroad engines and watercraft and airships! A steam-lovers utopia. This makes for a nice setting, and one that probably doesn't make it into too many games. However, it's pointless without a game that has goals and requires strategies for our players to achieve them.

### The Goal to Playing Steampunk world
What is the goal of playing open worlds like World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, Eve Online, Starcraft or any of the myriad of other online games?

- Leveling up ones character.
- Acquiring loot.
- Acquiring high level gear, artifacts and adornments.
- Acquiring skills to win competitions, either one-on-one, or in groups. The competition can be against other players, or against non-player characters (NPCs).

Those games are all combat related. Is that what I want? Conflict? There are other kinds of conflict that don't necessarily require hand-to-hand combat. Resource acquisition and strategy based games don't emphasize combat, though competing entities may come to blows over the desire the acquire certain resources.

I think I have in mind a game more along the lines of Sim City, where you guide policy to encourage NPCs to build what you want. I'm not sure if that works in an MMO setting. I may still be able to hold to a steampunk theme as an alternative to knights, crusaders, battle mages and the like.

Are there heros? If so, who are they defending and against what? What threats are there? Perhaps there are ways to drain resources that would threaten the health and prosperity of a given group.

Is there magic? If so, how does it manifest itself? How is it acquired, controlled and used? I like the idea of places of power that are unique to the individual. Perhaps a character can derive power from more than one location, but with varying degrees of efficacy.

## Characters
- Mimi Storm: extrovert, loud, injects self into conversation, gossip, wants to know everything about what others are doing in their lives.
- Criso Oliviera: extrovert, brilliant, irreverant. Frequently invokes the Immigrant Song.
