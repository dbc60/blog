[This article](http://writingcommons.org/index.php/open-text/style/point-of-view/635-understanding-second-person-point-of-view-wizard-activity) is the most enjoyable description of how to use the first, second and third person points of view I've ever seen. I have summarized a few good points.
<!--more-->

Even though the article's title is about understanding the second person point of view, it covers the first and third person as well. It probably does that for contrast and comparison.

- Use the first person for telling personal stories and anecdotes.
- Use the second person for things like instruction manuals, to paint a picture for people or to make clear that a situation is personally important to your reader. For example, I could say, "imagine that you need to finish a piece of writing for class and keep getting frustrating advice from crackpot wizards." You can also use the second person in role-playing games. For example, your character will be going on an adventure and you will suddenly be presented with a couple of options. "You turn left." "You turn right." I have fun playing those games.
- Use the third person when you want to present the thoughts of another character or group. This point of view enables you to know and talk about people besides yourself and what you have experienced. You could report on someone else's research, or describe what they need to do. You could write a story in which someone else went on an adventure. However, unlike the first person, the personal pronoun cannot be used to describe the character.

## Writing Prompts

### Dark Pools
> This pool you idly draw ripples in is deeper than you know, and the springs which feed it bear the names of the old places, the low places, where in quiet still flow the fountains of Darkness.

So, the fountains of Darkness quietly flow in low, old places, the names of which are born by springs feeding a pool.

Scripture refers to "the fountains of the deep." In the days of Noah and the Ark, these pools of water beneath the Earth's crust burst forth onto the surface providing the massive amounts of water needed for the global flood judgement. Specifically, in the King James Bible:

> In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.

### The Professional Tourist

> A man wearing khakis with lots of pockets, pulling a wheelie cart with handle, breezes through security of whichever airport he is in. He's a machinist. He encouters locks and opens them in moments. He's followed by another man wearing a pith helmet, sporting a handlebar moustache. The second man carries a large gun normally reserved for hunting elephants in the plains of Africa.

### Dystopian Story Topics

The lead in is at work, Mark accidentally left the wrapper on their PopTart when they put it in the microwave to warm it. Fireworks ensue. Laura commented that she believed the instructions on the box warns against leaving the wrapper on. Hillary quipped "that assumes anyone in the history of time has ever read the instruction on a box of pop tarts." Finally, Lucas wondered about how many Terms & Conditions he agreed to because he didn't read the toaster pastry boxes.

I had images of toaster pastries, meat pies, and Sweeney Todd running through my head after that exchange. That led me to think of a very dystopian society where the toaster pastry box obligates you to do something undesirable. Perhaps leaving your body or first born to the toaster pastry industry.

How to stop time: kiss.
How to travel in time: read.
How to escape time: music.
How to feel time: write.
How to release time: breathe.

## Strategies for Writing Essays and Articles

[Stephen Downes](http://www.downes.ca/post/38526) shared some of his strategies for writing. Part of his ability to being a prolific writer is tenacity. He writes in spare moments while waiting for other things to happen. Another part is a strategy that allows him to plan his entire essay as he writes it. He claims it allows him to make his first draft his final draft.

Unfortunately, this article has several typos and some meandering sentences. He really needs to edit it. Still, I found it interesting that essays and articles could be composed from four types of structures. Also, Downes describes how to identify each one, which could be useful in helping me figure out how to present ideas to readers.

### Four Types of Discursive Writing

Begin by writing - in your head, at least - your second paragraph. Your second paragraph will tell people what your essay says. Some people will write abstracts or executive summaries. You don't need to do this. You are stating your entire essay or article in one paragraph. If you were writing a news article, you would call this paragraph the 'lede'. A person could read just the one paragraph and know what you had to say.

How do you write this paragraph? For an essay or article, there are four types of discursive writing. Each of these types has a distinct and easy structure. You can apply each of these types depending on the kind of essay or article you intend to write. The four types of structure are: argument, explanation, definition, and description. Downes, for example, is writing a descriptive article.

These are our choices of types of article or essay:

- Argument: convinces someone of something
- Explanation: tells why something happened instead of something else
- Definition: states what a word or concept means
- Description: identifies properties or qualities of things

An *argument* is a collection of sentences (known formally as 'propositions') intended to convince the reader that something is the case. Perhaps you want to convince people to take some action, to buy some product, to vote a certain way, or to believe a certain thing. The thing that you want to convince them to believe is the conclusion. In order to convince people, you need to offer one or more reasons. Those are the premises. So one type of article consists of premises leading to a conclusion, and that is how you would structure your first paragraph.

An *explanation* tells the reader why something is the case. It looks at some event or phenomenon, and shows the reader what sort of things led up to that event or phenomenon, what caused it to happen, why it came to be this way instead of some other way. An explanation, therefore, consists of three parts. First, you need to identify the thing being explained. Then, you need to identify the things that could have happened instead. And finally, you need to describe the conditions and principles that led to the one thing, and not the other, being the case. And so, if you are explaining something, this is how you would write your first paragraph.

A *definition* identifies the meaning of some word, phrase or concept. There are different ways to define something. You can define something using words and concepts you already know. Or you can define something by giving a name to something you can point to or describe. Or you can define something indirectly, by giving examples of telling stories. A definition always involves two parts: the word or concepts being defined, and the set of sentences (or 'propositions') that do the defining. Whatever way you decide, this will be the structure of your article if you intend to define something.

A *description* provides information about some object, person, or state of affairs. It will consist of a series of related sentences. The sentences will each identify the object being defined, and the ascribe some property to that object. "The ball is red," for example, where the ball is the object and 'red' is the property. Descriptions may be of 'unary properties' - like color, shape, taste, and the like, or it may describe a relation between the object and one or more other objects.

### Organize Your Writing

The set of sentences will be organized in a few common ways.

- chronological order: "If this, then that," or "This happened, and then this happened."
- enumerate a set of properties, such as "appearance", "sound", "taste", "small", "feeling about", etc.
- elements of a list, such as "nine rules for good technology," or "then things you should learn."
- like reporters, cover _the five W's_: who, what, where, when, why.
- the step required to, say, write an essay.

### The First Paragraph

You are beginning with the second paragraph, so what happened to the first? The first paragraph is used to 'animate' your essay or article, to give it life and meaning and context. Downes animates his writing by writing a short story about himself showing how the topic is important to him. Animating paragraphs may express feelings - joy, happiness, sadness, or whatever. They may consist of short stories or examples of what you are trying to describe (this is very common in news articles). Animation may be placed into your essay at any point, but is generally most effective when introducing a topic, or when concluding a topic.

At this point in Downes essay, he gives the current point in the essay as an example. He's completed the first paragraph of his essay, and then expanded on it, thus ending the first major part of his essay. As an example of animation, he could give an example to illustrate his point in practice, and to give the reader a chance to reflect, and a way to experience some empathy, before proceeding. This is also a good place to offer a picture, diagram, illustration or chart of what you are trying to say in words.

And here is where he creates an outline of the four types of structure for an article or essay:

*Argument*:

    Premise 1
    Premise 2 ... (and more if needed)
    Conclusion

*Explanation*:

    Thing being explained
    Alternative possibilities
    Actual explanation

*Definition*:

    Thing being defined
    Actual definition

*Description*:

    Thing being described
    Descriptive sentence
    Descriptive sentence (and more, connected to the rest, as needed)

He concludes with stating the example should have made the concept clearer. You should easily see that your second paragraph will consist of two or more distinct sentences, depending on what you are trying to say. Now, all you need to do is to write the sentences. But also, you need to tell you reader which sentence is which. In an argument, for example, you need to clearly indicate to the reader which sentence is your conclusion and which sentences are your premises.

### Indicator Words

All four types of writing have their own indicator words. Let's look at each of the four types in more detail, and show (with examples, to animate!) the indicator words.

As stated above, an argument will consist of some premises and a conclusion. The conclusion is the most important sentence, and so will typically be stated first. For example, "Blue is better than red." Then a premise indicator will be used to tell the reader that what follows is a series of premises. Words like 'because' and 'since' are common premise indicators (there are more; you may want to make a list). So your first paragraph might look like this: "Blue is better than red, _because_ blue is darker than red, and all colors that are darker are better."

Sometimes, when the premises need to be stressed before the conclusion will be believed, the author will put the conclusion at the end of the paragraph. To do this, the author uses a conclusion indicator. Words like 'so' and 'therefore' and 'hence' are common conclusion indicators. Thus, for example, the paragraph might read: "Blue is darker than red, and all colors that are darker are better, so blue is better than red."

#### Arguments

- indicator words:
  - premise: since, because.
  - conclusion: therefore, so.
- types of arguments:
  - Inductive argument:
    - generalization: sample, poll, observation.
    - statistical: most, generally, usually, 70%, nine out of ten.
    - universal: always, all.
    - causal: causes.
  - Deductive argument:
    - categorical deductive argument: all, only, no, some, none.
    - propositional deductive argument: or, if, and.

Arguments can also be identified by their form. There are different types of arguments, which follow standard patterns of reasoning. These patterns of reasoning are indicated by the words being used. Here is a quick guide to the types of arguments:

*Inductive argument*: the premise consists of a 'sample', such as a series of experiences, or experimental results, or polls. Watch for words describing these sorts of observation. The conclusion will be inferred as a generalization, such as 'most', 'generally', 'usually', 'seventy percent', 'nine out of ten', and so on. Also, watch for words that indicate a universal generalization such as 'always' and 'all'.

A special case of the inductive argument is the _causal generalization_. If you want someone to believe that one thing causes another, then you need to show that there are many cases where the one thing was followed by the other, and also to show that when the one thing didn't happen, then the other didn't either. This establishes a 'correlation'. The argument becomes a causal argument when you appeal to some general principle or law of nature to explain the correlation. Notice how, in this case, an explanation forms one of the premises of the argument.

*Deductive argument*: the premises consist of propositions, and the conclusion consists of some logical manipulation of the premises. A _categorical_ argument, for example, consists of reasoning about sets of things, so watch for words like 'all', 'some' and 'none'. Many times, these words are implicit. When Downes said "Blue is better than red", he meant that "blue is always better than red," and that's how is how I understood it.

Another type of deductive argument is a _propositional_ argument. Propositional arguments are manipulations of sentences using the words 'or', 'if' and 'and'. For example, if I said "Either red is best or blue is best, and red is not best, so blue is best," then I have employed a propositional argument.

It is useful to learn the basic argument forms, so you can very clearly indicate which type of argument you are providing. This will make your writing clearer to the reader, and will help them evaluate your writing. And in addition, this will make it easier for you to write your article.

Here Downes instructs us to look at how the previous paragraph is constructed. He stated a conclusion, then a premise indicator, and then a series of premises. It was very easy for him to write the paragraph. He just wrote something he thought was true, then provided a list of the reasons he thought it was true.

#### Explanations

- indicator words and phrases: why, because, instead of.
- types of explanations:
  - causal explanation: why, because, since, instead of.
  - statistical explanation: percent, probability.

In a similar manner, an explanation will also use indicator words. The words used are very similar to those in an argument. For example, I might explain by saying "The grass is green because it rained yesterday." I am explaining why the grass is green. The word 'because' is the indicator here.

People often confuse arguments and explanations, because they use similar indicator words. So when you are writing, you can make your point clearer by using words that will generally be unique to explanations.

In general, explanations are answers to 'why' questions. They consider why something happened 'instead of' something else. Usually, they will say that something was 'caused' by something else. So when offering an explanation, use these words as indicators. For example, "It rained yesterday. That's why the grass is green, instead of brown."

Almost all explanations are causal explanations, but in some cases (especially when describing complex states and events) you will also appeal to a statistical explanation. In essence, in a statistical explanation, you are saying, "it had to happen sometime, so that's why it happened now, but there's no reason, other than probability, why it happened this time instead o last time or next time." When people see somebody who was killed by lightening, and they say, "His number was just up," they are offering a statistical explanation.

#### Definitions

- indicator words and phrases: that's what I mean by, all and only, if and only if, all x are y, only x does y.
- three types of definitions:
  - ostensive: that's what I mean by.
  - lexical: all, only, is a type of, is necessarily.
  - implicit: is a, for example.

Definitions are trickier, because there are various types of definition. I will consider three types of definition: ostensive, lexical, and implicit.

#### Descriptions

- indicator words and phrases: first, and then, and finally, yesterday, then today, and tomorrow.
- some types of descriptive essays and articles:
  - chronology: yesterday, today.
  - sensations: seems, feels, appears.
  - list: first, second, etc.
  - Five W's: who, what, where, when, why.

### Complex Forms

In Downes' article, he went through his list of types of articles of essays three times (including the summary). Each successive iteration (which has been followed by one of his tables) added more detail. He suggests that we might ask how this is so, if there are only four types or articles or essays.

The point is, each sentence in one type of thing might be a whose set of sentences in another type of thing. This is most clearly illustrated by looking at an argument.

An argument is a conclusion and some premises, like this:

    Statement 1, and
    Statement 2,
    Thus,
    Statement 3

Each premise might in turn be the conclusion of another argument, like this:

    Statement 4, and
    Statement 5,
    Thus,
    Statement 1

Which gives us a complex argument:

    Statement 4, and
    Statement 5,
    Thus Statement 1
    Statement 2
    Thus Statement 3

But this can be done with all four types of paragraph. For example, consider this:

    Statement 1 (which is actually a definition, with several parts)
    Statement 2 (which is actually a description)
    Thus,
    Statement 3

So, when you write your essay, you pick the main thing you want to say. For example:

    Second paragraph:

    Statement 1, and
    Statement 2
    Thus
    Statement 3

    Third Paragraph:

    Statement 4 (thing being defined)
    Statement 5 (properties)
    Statement 1 (actual definition)

    Fourth Paragraph:

    Statement 5 (first statement of description)
    Statement 6 (second statement of description)
    Statement 2 (summary of description)

As you can see, each simple element of an essay - premise, for example - can become a complex part of an essay - the premise could be the conclusion of an argument, for example. So, when you write your essay, you just go deeper and deeper into the structure.

You may ask, when does it stop? For Downes, it stops with descriptions - something he's seen or experienced, or a reference to a study or a paper. To others, it all reduces to definitions and axioms. For still others, it might never stop. You rarely get to the bottom. You simply go on until you've said enough. In essence, you give up, and hop the reader can continue the rest of the way on his or her own.

## Representing Arguments

Arguments can be represented in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). It's mostly a tree structure, although some premises might support multiple conclusions, so it's inherently a graph form. Because some conclusions are lemmas, supporting further conclusions, arguments can go several levels deep.

One method to presenting an argument to the reader is to try to analyze the argument to find the points closest to the conclusion that are not controversial. Start with those, and then try to talk about the surprising conclusion that they imply.
