The purpose of project planning is to create the foundation for a visible sense of progress at each stage of the project. What this means is that as each step o the plan is completed there is evidence of progress.

## Experiments vs Commitments
I was reading [My advice on learning Python efficiently][2] because I'm interested in learning Python. That led me to [How to Build the Habit of Finishing What You Start][1] which highlighted a useful way to distinguish between projects you should finish and those that are okay to abandon. The author separates projects into two kinds: those that are experiements and those that are commitments. It is the key to deciding what's worth finishing, no matter how boring, dull or uninspiring, and what's okay to quit.

While it can be helpful to think of projects in these terms, it leaves out an important category. We not only have experiments and commitments. We also have obligations, and they take the greatest priority as far as time and effort are concerned.

## Planning Overview
Planning begins with knowing what needs to be done. For this we need a:

- Design document
- Task list containing
  - a list of the major tasks that need to be done.
  - a list of subtasks for each task.
- Dependency list showing which tasks can't be started until another task is started or completed.
- Schedule showing when each piece (subproject) will be started and the corresponding milestone will be achieved.
- Budget including costs of possible catastrophies as well as the costs of obvious price tags.
- Risk mitigation plan - actions you can take to reduce the cost of various problems that might happen.

Note: a milestone is just a subproject that consists of a small set of features or components that can be created/built in a short period of time (a few weeks to a few months). Does an Agile Development process consider a "sprint" just a unit of work, or does it intend for a feature or component to be completed during that time?

## The Design Document
A design document describes the idea and plans for the completed project. It should contain the following:

- Design Summary
- Design Details
- Designer Notes
- Future Features
- Glossary
- Version History

If the project is for something saleable, then the design document should also contain a section on the Business Model to be used to market and sell the end product.

### Design Summary
The design summary, also called the _treatment_, describes what is to be created. If it's a game, the summary describes what makes the game unique and fun to play. If it's a home renovation, it describes what problems the renovation is resolving, the planned solution and how those changes fix the problems. It answers the questions, "What's the dream? What do you envision?"

Write a storyboard. For a game, step through a player's experience from start to finish in general terms, such as login, character creation, game start, general progression and possible endings. For a home renovation, compare the present experience to the one envisioned after the renovation.

### Design Details
Describe the end product in its entirety using enough detail so that in a couple of weeks or months, you can read it again and know what you were trying to achieve. The more complicated a project, the more details that need to be written down. Include descriptions of how things created in the project will be used. For example, a card game might include descriptions of

- the deck of cards
- the number of players
- how cards are dealt
- the rules about playing, discarding and acquiring new cards
- how the game is won

Instead of gameplay, a kitchen renovation would describe various uses of the kitchen, and analagously, the workflow through the kitchen for cooking and cleaning. It would include the location of

- work surfaces
- cooking tools & utensils
- appliances
- foods (fresh, frozen, canned, jarred, boxed and bagged)
- herbs and spices
- condiments
- cleaning products and tools

Since the kitchen tends to be a gathering place for conversation, the details might also include how many butts can comfortably fit, and how those in the kitchen interact with those in adjacent rooms. Can others be heard or seen? Is there a common counter, and do people sit at or stand by it? How does it affect the social interactions that will play out during the course of the day?

### Designer Notes
Include all of your notes in the design document. The designer notes detail the reasons for design decisions, such as why things function the way they do, or why a particular piece of furniture or cabinetry was chosen. This way, you won't have to try to remember why you designed things the way you did. It will be written down.

Keep notes on your design decisions as you make them. Record why you made the decisions you've made. This will help you to reconstruct your reasoning and remember the constraints under which you were working.

It is probably a good idea to embed your notes in the subsection of the design details section to which they apply, rather than placing them in their own section. They will be easier to find and reference.

### Future Features
As you flesh out your design, you will will have ideas that are worth remembering. Also as the project progresses, you may find the need to simplify by not incorporating all the originally planned features. In these cases, place or move those ideas and features into a **Future Features** section. This way, you will have an easy reference to good ideas.

### Glossary
It's all about terms and TLAs (Three Letter Acronyms). This section records words and phrases as they are used in the context of the project. It's particularly useful in projects, such as saleable products, where common words are used in a specific context, so have nuances to their exact meaning. Even a home renovation project might have terms and phrases, such as those used in the context of building permits or general construction, that aren't apparent to laypersons.

### Version History
As you make changes to the design document, it's useful t track them. When you first create the design document, you're adding to it more than changing it, so it might not be necessary to track changes. Once the design is stable, you should start keeping track of what changes are made.

You don't need a lot of details here. Just write down the date, the name of the person who made the change and a short summary of what was changed. *Why* the change was made should be part of the designer's notes. The summary of what was changed will track to the section where the designer's notes state why it was changed.

Here's an simple example of all that is needed:

| Date | Author | Summary of Changes |
|-----------:|-------------:|:------------|
| 2016.03.18 | John Does | Initial draft |
| 2016.03.22 | Alice Moore | Replaced building a snog widget with buying two fargle gadgets. |

### How Long is Long Enough?
It should be long enough to be useful as a guide for the project and a reminder of the goals you're working toward. If you're not careful, it can take on a life of its own. It is only the beginning of the project, not an end unto itself.

On the other hand, if it's too short you will run the risk of losing your way. I don't worry about this possibility so much. If you find you're not clear how to proceed at some stage of the project, it means there's more planning to do. Return to the design document. Review what you have planned and completed so far, and consider the fuzzy part more deeply. Figure out what you want or need to do next, record your design decisions and next steps, and then get back to work.

## Project Planning
This stage, also known as *pre-production*, involves deciding what tasks need to be done and in what order to do them to complete the project. Your design document describes the desired end product. Now is the time to figure out how to get there.

We get there by identifying tasks and scheduling them, considering the costs (budgeting), looking at the possible obstacles to success (risk management) and considering how to fund the project.

### Make a Task List
The first step is to make a list of everything that needs to be done. Work from your design document. It contains all of the features and story elements you expect to fulfill when the project is complete.
Each of these features and elements can be considered a top-level task.

Once you've collected your top-level tasks into a list, make a list under each task specifying the steps needed to complete it. Get as detailed as you need. Know that for complex projects, you can have more than two levels of tasks. Break down tasks into simpler steps until you feel comfortable that you understand what needs to be done.

On the other hand, there's a rule-of-thumb for estimating the time a task should take that says you shouldn't estimate less than one hour for each task. If you have tasks that you think will take only a few minutes, you've divided things up too finely. Bundle those tasks with others to simplify the list.

Don't be afraid to reorganize your tasks as you go. Sometimes you have a top-level task that turns out to be a subtask of something else. A task may be too broad, so it should be divided into two or more separate tasks.

### Identity Dependencies Among the Tasks
Here you will create a list of task dependencies. This will help you figure out a schedule the tasks. It shows which task or tasks must be completed before another can be started. You can't hang the drapes before the walls are painted without taking down the drapes and hanging them again after the paint has dried.

There may also be resource dependencies, where a tool or skilled labor is required to complete a task. For example, if the task requires electrical work, you might want to hire an electrician, or make sure you get the necessary tools, wire, and electrical components to do it yourself.

Once you have identified all dependencies, go back through the list and sort the tasks according to the order they must be completed. Once you have your list of tasks, and you've figured out which tasks need to be done first, you're ready to create a schedule of milestones for your project.

## Scheduling Project Milestones
The first part of scheduling is to get estimates for each task. With the estimates in hand, you can schedule the milestones.

### Task Time Estimation
This is really guesswork. How good your guesses are depend on your experience with the tasks at hand and a little bit of luck. Don't try to be precise. Your goal is only to get an idea as to how long the overall project will take. Expect the actual times to complete tasks to vary from your estimates.

One way to guess at how long the project will take is to estimate the amount of time each top-level task will take. Likewise, get the estimate for each top-level task by first guessing how long each of its subtasks will take. When you have estimates for the lowest level tasks, add them up for the next higher level task. Continue adding up estimates from low-level tasks to higher-level ones until all the tasks have estimates. Finally, add up the estimates for the top-level tasks to estimate the project duration.

A rule of thumb for estimating is that no task should take less than one hour. If you have such tasks, you've broken down the work too finely. In this case, collect and combine those tasks with related ones to make a simpler task list.

On the other hand, if a lowest-level task takes more than 40 hours to complete, you might want to break it down into smaller tasks. Some even recommend that tasks be broken down to require [no more than 16 hours](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/10/26.html) of effort. It's a rule-of-thumb, so do whatever you feel comfortable with.

### Creating Milestones
Milestones, or development phases, are mini-projects within the overall project. They are based on the path you decide to take for completing the project. They help to provide a sense of accomplishment as they are much smaller than the overall project.

For your first milestone, decide where in your project some component will be completed. Make it something that acts as a foundation on which the rest of the project will be built.

Using your detailed task list and list of task dependencies, find all those items that must be done in order to complete the first milestone. If you find your task list for this first milestone comprises more than 20%-25% of your total list of tasks, then you might want to trim down your goals for the milestone.

Likewise, if the milestone is going to take more than a few months, consider trimming ti down. Move some of the featuers from this milestone to the next one, if you can.

When you are satisfied with your first milestone, take your poroject to the next level and create your second milestone. Choose the features you will implement in milstone two based on what was accomplished in milstone one. Again, try not to pull more than 20%-25% o fthe ful task list into the secon milestone (unless your project is very simple). Continue this way until the last milestone is the completed project.

## Prototype Task Tracking in a Spreadsheet
Initially, I think the spreadsheet can contain a few tables of data needed to define the tasks in a project and track worker's estimates vs. actual results. These tables will provide two useful pieces of data. The first is a way to estimate the project completion date based on task assignments and worker velocities. The second is that workers will be able to see how well they can estimate various tasks by viewing their history of velocities. Each velocity is merely the estimate for a task divided by the actual time required to complete the task.

Here are the table definitions:

### Project Tables
Each project will have an ID, a name and a short description. If a longer description is required, I can add a new table of two columns that links the project ID to a longer description.

#### Projects Table
The `Projects` table lists all of the projects in the spreadsheet/database. If there is only one project in the spreadsheet, then this table is not necessary and its information can be a part of the spreadsheet's title.

- `ProjectID`: a unique monotonically increasing number. It is the primary key.
- `ProjectName`: a short string that represents a human readable name for the project.
- `ProjectSummary`: a short string that summarizes what the project is about.

#### The Optional Project Descriptions Table
The `ProjectsDescriptions` table consists of the following fields:

- `ProjectID`: the foreign key to the Projects table.
- `ProjectDescription`: a longer description for a project. This might be implemented as a BLOB in a database.

#### Project Start Dates
When a project is assigned a start date it will have an entry in the `ProjectsStartDates` table.

- `ProjectID`: the foreign key to the Projects table.
- `ProjectStart`: a date indicating when the project starts. If there's no record of a project in this table, then it hasn't yet started.

### Feature Tables
I think features should have a name, description and priority. Each feature could be associated with one or more projects. I suppose there could be orphaned features that are not associated with any project, but I don't think that's interesting at this early stage of planning.

#### Features Table
The `Features` table lists all of the features in all of the projects in the spreadsheet/database.

- `FeatureID`: primary key
- `FeatureName`
- `FeatureSummary`
- `FeaturePriority`: a foreign key into one of the values from the FeaturePriorities table, below (many-to-one: many of these entries each map to one entry in the [FeaturePriorities](#feature-priorities-table) table).

#### Feature Priorities Table
The `FeaturePriorities` Table is a table with static data.

- `FeaturePriorityID`: a number, 1 - 7; the primary key.
- `FeaturePriorityName`: a string that may be one of the following values:
    1. `Urgent`
    2. `High`
    3. `Important`
    4. `Medium`
    5. `Moderate`
    6. `Low`
    7. `Not Important`

#### Projects and Features Table
The `ProjectsFeatures` table associates various features with the projects to which they belong (one-to-many: one project maps to many features):

- ProjectID: a foreign key into the Projects table.
- FeatureID: a foreign key into the Features table.

### Workers Table
The Workers table lists all of the persons who will work on the various projects planned.

- `WorkerID`: the primary key
- `WorkerName`: some human-readable representation of the worker. A string that represents the worker's first and last names might be nice. If there's a reason to alphabetize workers by their family name (surname), then this field can be split into `WorkerGivenName`  and `WorkerSurname`.

### Task Tables
Tasks must be recorded, and associated with features and workerss. Also, it might be nice to record dependencies among tasks to determine which tasks must be done before others can be started.

#### Tasks Table
The Tasks table lists all of the tasks in all of the projects.

- `TaskID`: the primary key
- `TaskName`: the name of the task
- `TaskSummary`: a short description of the task
- `TaskTypeID`: a foreign key to the `TaskTypes` table

An alternative implementation of the `Tasks` table is to combine all the fields above with all the fields of the `WorkersTasks` table below. There is a zero-or-one to one correspondence between these two tables, so we might want to combine them into a single table:

- `TaskID`: the primary key
- `TaskName`: the name of the task
- `TaskSummary`: a short description of the task
- `TaskTypeID`: a foreign key to the `TaskTypes` table
- `WorkerID`: a foreign key into the Workers table for the worker assigned to this task (unless no one has been assigned yet)
- `EstimatedEffort`: an estimate of the amount of effort or time the worker expects it will take him/her to complete the task. The value could be points to represent effort or time in hours, days or some other interval. I have yet to decide what the value actually represents, but it must be used consistently throughout the spreadsheet/database.
- `ActualEFfort`: the current amount of effort a worker has expended on this task. It is in the same units as the `EstimatedEffort`
- `IsComplete`: a Boolean to indicate whether the worker believes the task is complete or not. Make it true if the task is complete, and false otherwise. If it's false, the value of the `ActualEffort` indicates the effort applied to the task so far.


#### Task Types Table
The `TaskTypes` table provides a type to associate with each task. It may be useful for making refinements on velocities. For example, we might want to see how good workers are at estimating programming tasks vs design tasks, or GUI programming vs Systems programming, or carpentry vs electrical or plumbing tasks.

- `TaskTypeID`: a unique ID. It is the primary key.
- `TaskTypeName`: a unique name for the task type.

#### Features and Tasks Table
The FeatureTasks table links each feature in the Feature table to the set of tasks from the Tasks table that must be done to create the feature (one-to-many: one feature maps to many tasks).

- FeatureID: a foreign key into the Features table
- TaskID: a foreign key into the Tasks table

#### Workers and Tasks Table
There needs to be a record of each task that each worker plans to work on, along with an estimate of the effort or time it will take to complete it. It's expected that the worker assigned to the given task will estimate the effort to complete the task. This is tracked in the `WorkersTasks` table.

- `WorkerTaskID`: the primary key of this table - is this necessary? Won't the WorkerID and TaskID fields uniquely identify an entry in this table?
- `WorkerID`: a foreign key into the Workers table
- `TaskID`: a foreign key into the Tasks table
- `EstimatedEffort`: an estimate of the amount of effort or time the worker expects it will take him/her to complete the task. The value could be points to represent effort or time in hours, days or some other interval. I have yet to decide what the value actually represents, but it must be used consistently throughout the spreadsheet/database.
- `ActualEFfort`: the current amount of effort a worker has expended on this task. It is in the same units as the `EstimatedEffort`
- `IsComplete`: a Boolean to indicate whether the worker believes the task is complete or not. Make it true if the task is complete, and false otherwise. If it's false, the value of the `ActualEffort` indicates the effort applied to the task so far.

##### Worker Velocity
The velocity of a worker is calculated only if the task is complete. The value is simply:

 $$\mathrm{Velocity} = \frac{\mathrm{EstimatedEffort}}{\mathrm{ActualEffort}}$$

##### Different Workers Assigned to a Task
What if a different worker is assigned to a task at different times in the task's life? Does each worker get to assign an estimate? Perhaps so. Sometimes work needs to be transferred from one worker to another. In that case, the task should have a field called `IsComplete`, and the effort from each worker should be summed to obtain the `TotalActualEffort`, but how does this affect each worker's velocity? I'm not sure it does, so I'm not sure the `TotalActualEffort` on a task is useful.

On the other hand, it would be a lot mroe simple to create another task, or to track records in the [`WorkersTasks` table](#workers-and-tasks-table) and consider each worker's effort on the task as a separate 'load' on the overall project. Consider a rule that states the links between entries in the `WorkersTasks` table and the `Tasks` table are one-to-one (in which case, the fields in the `WorkersTasks` table should just be moved into the `Tasks` table).

#### Task Dependencies Table
The `TaskDependencies` table links each "dependent" task to the task(s) which must be started or finished before the dependent task can be started or finished. There are four dependency types listed in the TaskDependencyTypes table.

- DependentTask: the higher-level task ID. It is a foreign key into the Tasks table.
- PredecessorTask: the task that must be started or finished before the DependentTask can be started of finished.
- DependencyType: a foreign key to the TaskDependencyTypes table indicating the type of dependency between these two tasks.

#### Task Dependency Types Table
The TaskDependencyTypes table lists the four different types of dependencies that may exist between two tasks (other than no dependency at all).

- TaskDependencyTypeID: a number, 1 - 4.
- TaskDependencyTypeName: a string that is one of the following values:
    1. finish-to-start
    2. start-to-start
    3. finish-to-finish
    4. start-to-finish

### Scheduled Tasks
We need to keep a record of all tasks that have been assigned a start date or a number indicating the particular cycle of the project's iteratiive development process in which they will begin. If the cycle representation is chosen, then the development process begins on the project's start date. Each cycle could have a default number of points associated with it (or a number of points tailored to that particular cycle, if needed). The spreadsheet/database could then be used to provide some amount of sorting to the tasks to make it easier to schedule them, and it could even suggest a schedule by placing tasks into cycles, filling each cycle in turn with as many tasks as possible.

The spreadsheet database should contain enough data to determine the earliest start date of any particular task using the [`TaskDependencies` table](#task-dependencies-table) and the project start date. If cycles are assigned a budget of effort points, then tasks could be allocated to cycles so as not to exceed each cycle's budget. By varying the budget for each cycle (or all cycles using a default budget) and varying the length of each cycle we can see the effect on the entire schedule.

Can worker velocities and Monte Carlo simulation also be put to use to calculate the likelihood that the project will finish on a particular date?

What do we do with tasks that don't have an estimated effort, yet? They obviously can't be scheduled, and add an unknown amount of uncertainty to the project's completion date.

Should scope creep be tracked? That is, do we have to record when features and their associated tasks are removed or added to the project? If so, we could then calculate the total effort required to finish the project and project the effects of adding or removing tasks at various times during the project, as well as keep track of the baseline (what we started with).

#### Schedule Variables

- Cycle length: try 14 days as a starting point
- Maximum task size: 16 units of effort, which maps to about one hour per effort unit based on an eight hour work day and a requirement to track work/effort at a granularity that's no finer than one hour. We will stay away from actual values of time to avoid angst when it comes to comparing estimated and actual effort and calculating velocity. It may be that our velocities average between zero and one. This means our estimates are poor and work is taking longer than predicted. It's easier to say a task takes more effort than predicted than it is to say it takes more time than we "committed to".
- Effort budget per cycle: this depends on the project. For a 40 hour work week, a two week cycle and a maximum budget of 16 units per task, I might want to have a budget of 80 effort units per cycle. On the hand, a personal project where only an hour a day Monday through Friday and maybe an additional 8 hours over the weekend are available, I'll budget at most 26 units of effort per cycle.

What if we go completely arbitrary and say that no task may be larger than 100 units? If we assign a two week interval for a cycle, I think that means a full-time job should have no more than 500 units of work allocated each cycle. Also, no task should be estimated more finely than 5 units (to pick an easy value to deal with).

To get back to the single-unit granularity, divide the values above by 5. We then get 20 units as the maximum for any task and 100 units of effort per cycle. I like those numbers. There nice and round and will be easy to manage. Remember: if a task seems to need more than 20 units of effort, then it needs to be broken down into a set of smaller tasks that are no more than 20 units each.

With this new mapping we have:

- Cycle length: 14 days
- Maximum task size: 20 units
- Cycle budget:
    - 40 hour work week: 100 units units per cycle
    - 13 hour part-time work week: about 32 units per cycle

#### Applying the Effort Budget to Tasks in Each Cycle
Interesting! There may be cases where there are no tasks that will evenly fill a cycle. I can either leave some empty (slack) time by not completely filling the cycle, or I can completely fill the cycle by scheduling a partial task at the end. The first case is simple, and will provide a way include slack time in case estimates early on in the project are too low.

The second case adds complexity to the scheduling. I'd have to be able to track partially complete tasks between cycles. I'll probably need to do this regardless, as I won't always hit my target of completing all scheduled tasks in each cycle. I don't want to stuff the schedule, but I will find a way to carry over incomplete tasks from one cycle to the next.

## Budgeting
The first part of making a budget is knowing how much things cost. Make a list of the kinds of things you will spend money on. In game development, some of the common items are:

- Labor
- Development Hardware
- Development Workspace
- Development Tools
- Consumables (paper, ink, CDs)
- Project-Specific Third-Party Components (3D engine, motion capture)
- Project Managemnet (communications equipement, software, version control, defect tracker)
- Legal (mainly contracts, but also terms of service, warranties/guaranties, Service Level Agreement)
- Accounting (bookkeeping, taxes)
- Marketing (Web presence)

### Identify Your Project Costs
Review your design document and production planning documents to identify all of the tasks that need to be paid for. Think in terms of packages and subsystems.

Once you've identified your irreducible costs - the components or infrastructure elements that the project must have - use your production schedule to see when those costss will need to be paid. Look closely to see if any will need to be paid at or near the same time, or within the same project milstone period. You many be able to juggle your scedule sufficiently to spread costs over a longer period, or at least prevent them from becomming due all at once.

## Risk Management
Basically, risk management is about identifying as many risks to the project as possible before beginning the project and then deciding how those risks will be handled when or if they occur.

### Identify and Plan for Risks
Budgeting is part of risk management. It helps you identify costs taht you cannot avoid. You must then come up with a way to manage those risks (costs in this case) by either paying them out of pocket or some other way.

You also have to review your game design and production plan while asking the question "What could go wrong?" Look for features that might prove more difficult than predicted, and what other features will be affected by not getting these done on time. What if a feature or component turns out to be impossible, or at least infeasible? How does the game, project or final product change as a result?

Start looking for the worst case risks and assume they *will* happen, and then pull back to focus on more realistic circumstances. Look at what could go wrong and what steps could be taken to prevent the problem or establish a course of action to take if/when it happens.

### Keep Records
Another important part of risk management is keeping records. We already keep records and receipts as part of paying taxes. This is important for projects, whether it be game development or a kitchen renovation. Even if the project is little more than a hobby, keep records of all expenses incured by and for the project. The project coulld become profitable, which is much more likely if you prepare for it.

Whenever you pay project costs out of your own pocket, keep track of them in detail. Wherever possible, keep the receipt for the transaction. Besides being able to claim these as business costs on your annual taxes, they are also expenses that should be recouped prior to profit-sharing when the game begins making moneyu. If there are other team members investing project-specific monies, you should record these, too, and allow them to recoup those expenses before profit-sharing, as well.

Detailed recordkeeping is also useful for reviewing your budgeted costs versus actual costs, not only when the project is completed, but during project development so you can tell if you have to take a risk-mitigation action (such as cut or defer a feature, or find additional funding). It will also help you make better estimates in future projects - you'll have a record of what costs you underestimated or overestimated.

You don't need to have a full accounting system. Start out with a simple spreadsheet that has one line per transaction and a separate file for keeping track of receipts.
