What steps are left to actually launch this blog even though there are styling, presentation, and organizational issues I would like to address?
<!--more-->

What should the cadence of blog posts be? Can I create weekly posts? I think I should be able to post at least monthly.

What content should I post? Just technical or should I include family events? Initially, I think posts should be mostly technical, but I get the feeling that intermixing some personal elements would be okay. Things like my background, where I'm working, my struggles with the commute, my sister's situation, how proud I am of my daughter and son, far away family, friends (my Dojo family in particular), gaming, etc.

1. Consider bringing forward a few of the old posts

   - [A Blog on GitHub](http://douglascuthbertson.com/blog/2015/12/30/blogging-on-github/)
   - Tuck away [A Quick Note on Python](http://douglascuthbertson.com/blog/2016/01/04/a-quick-note-on-python/) as a note until I decide to pursue Python again.
   - maybe keep [Serving a Blog](http://douglascuthbertson.com/blog/2016/09/04/serving-a-blog-site/)
   - [A Dangerous Spectacle](http://douglascuthbertson.com/blog/2016/11/09/the-spectacle/)

1. At least 3 articles exploring the same subject. For example, D3, Python, Go, Project Planning, Hugo, CSS and SCSS, Markdown and reStructuredText, Blogging in general.
1. Have at least 12 articles "in the can" for publication so you have time to work on more.
1. Learn how to use Twitter to annouce new articles, link to news reports so I can express my rage at the Trump administration, and retweet interesting tweets from others.
1. Make tickets on GitHub for work to update the presentation of this blog. These don't have to be done before relaunch. Their purpse is to track changes I want to make.

   - ensure the blog is presentable w/o JavaScript (noscript extension)
   - make a sidebar component and place the navigation menu there.
   - consider a header image. Rotate through 12 monthly, 24 semi-monthly, or as many as 52 weekly header images.

I have a lot of notes. I should create series of articles with similar themes. and move them to post with publication dates where possible. It is also okay to have a single post on a single subject - perhaps posting such things between series.

Consider subdirectories for the `note/project` folder to help organize project notes. I can see a few categories:

- `anki`. Keep notes about learning, using, and styling anki cards.
- `hugo`. Keep notes about learning, using, and configuring it.
- `web`. Move `note/web` under `note/project` and write about HTML, CSS, SCSS, and file organization in web projects (like this blog).
- `filing`. Write about struggles with keeping paper files organized.
- `budget` or `finanaces`. Ways of keeping a budget, making investments, and managing money.
- `gaming`. Play. Games online and offline.
- `game development`. Handmade Hero, and other inspirations. Tools. Techniques.
- `graphics`. D3, sketching, and related thoughts on visual design and presetation.
- `home renovation`. The kitchen cabinet project, and others.
- `book reviews`. That might motivate me to read more and take notes on technical books.
