We need to remodel our old kitchen so it is more functional an more pleasant to work in. The floor tiles are chipping and our cabinets are falling apart.

## Design Summary

TBD

## Design Details

Here's a quick list of what we need to do:

- \\(\square\\) Select coutertops
- \\(\square\\) Tear up floor tile
- \\(\square\\) Fix subfloor
- \\(\square\\) Put down new tile, linoleum or other surface
- \\(\square\\) Select flooring
- \\(\square\\) Replace ceiling light fixture with one that uses the new energy efficient bulbs (soon the bulbs it uses won't be made)
- \\(\square\\) Choose and buy new task lighting
- \\(\square\\) Consider new light between dining room and kitchen to light the counter
- \\(\square\\) Remove soffits between kitchen and dining room. Not all soffits can be removed. Sometimes they carry plumbing, electrical services or structural supports. See the following articles for idea on removing and disguising soffits.
