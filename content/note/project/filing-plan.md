This filing plan is more fleshed out than [the alternate plan](/note/projects/filing-plan-alternate). It also moves the section on `Computer Backup Files and Passwords` from its own section to a part under [Section 9 General Records](#9 General Records).

## Categories
I'm not sure about the sections listed in the Brief Outline, below. Here are some other top-level sections that might work (in no particular order):

- Auto Maintenance
- Taxes with sections by year.
- Bank Statements
- Health Records: by person. Complete medical, dental, vision, prescription and other records.
- Insurance Records
- Titles & Deeds
- Lynn's Special Needs Trust. This includes the trust and all financial records associated with it.
- Bills. This includes the paper bills we still receive, and a list of reminders for the electronic bills we pay regularly. It should probably have a list of the login IDs and passwords necessary to access those accounts online, too.

How do we file retirement plans and investments? Some of them are with banks, and others are with other financial institutions. I suppose there could be slips of paper to cross-reference categories/sections in the filing system, so when I look up taxes, I'll see notes to look in bank statements, retirement plans and other financial "instruments".

- Utilities: agreements, contracts, how to pay (online w/login IDs and passwords), whether or not they are on an automatic payment plan.
- Other Gov't and Legal Records
    - Census: I'd like to keep a record that the town and federal census has been filled out. The former is important for voting records. The latter, just because it's the federal gov't.
    - Jury Duty.

I used LedgerSMB for a short time to keep a budget. The budget and expense categories might prove useful for a filing system, too. Here they are:

1. Reference Material. Maybe this could be a locator list, so things can be found more easily. That might mean, each item should be labeled with its "proper" location so it can be returned there. It's a library?! Checkout and return. I wonder if that could ever work at home. Manually, it would be way too fiddly - not unlike using that LedgerSMB software for budgeting (too much manual work to keep it up-to-date).
