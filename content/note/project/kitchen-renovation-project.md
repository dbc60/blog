We need to remodel our old kitchen so it is more functional an more pleasant to work in. The floor tiles are chipping and our cabinets are falling apart.

## Project Summary
The general idea is to:

- remove the cabinet tower and the cabinets over the counter between the kitchen and dining room to open up the space.
- replace the cabinets under the counter between the kitchen and dining room with two that will store table linens on the dining room side
