Notes from [Too Many Startups Like Playing Startup](https://www.groovehq.com/blog/startups-playing-startup).
<!--more-->

The author says there are seven signs that indicate you might be playing startup:

1. Too many meetings.
1. Having multiple persons do what a single person can do. In other words, hiring more people than you really need.
1. Worshipping vanity benchmarks. This is a repeat of the previous one. It doesn't address what "vanity benchmark" means. It only uses "hiring more people to look big" as an example of a vanity benchmark.
1. Spending a lot of time at meetups, because networking _feels like work_.
1. Sponsoring conferences - it's a waste of money.
1. Overspending on swag, business cards and office space.
1. Having more conversations with people outside of your market than people in it.

## Setting the Stage for Boostrapping a SaaS Startup
The first rule is that building and running a SaaS business has _nothing_ to do with your ability to write code. Code is the least important thing about a SaaS business. Typically, codebases are dismal abysses of darkness, pain and the cause for much wailing and gnashing of teeth. The reason is that a business's software serves one purpose and one purpose only: To make the business money.

Ask yourself how any of these goals that developers might have will make the business money:

- comprehensive unit tests for your entire codebase
- dependency injection (DI)
- inversion of control (IoC)
- any software framework

Contrast those with the following:

- The customer is requesting a feature. How fast can we build that so we can get them to buy?
- We think making this change will get more signups. How fast can we make that happen?
- This thing is completely broken right now and we have customers cancelling! How fast can we get a fix in?

The point is not to abandon software engineering principles, but to focus work on those things that make money for the business. It's about the product, not the code. Customers care about the product. You are the only one who cares about your code.

The other thing to realize is that once your product is off the ground, you'll spend very little time writing code.

### Ideas are only Guesses
Your idea is worth something only if other people care about it. Your SaaS business idea is just a _guess_! You don't have an idea, you have a hunch or guess. Think of it that way - just a guess. It will help to disassociate your emotions from the process.

The next few sections talk about creating your message so you can go **Prospecting**, **Qualifying and Investigating**, **Demonstrating** and **Closing** commitments for sales. This is all to test to see if we can sell our solution, and identify to whom we could sell it, and why.

As of the beginning of [Part 2](https://medium.com/@cliffordoravec/the-no-bs-approach-to-building-your-saas-startups-launch-list-part-2-of-the-epic-guide-to-8cc371be772c#.e5m2bz5ds), the process is:

- Find the right words for your message
    - What do I think people want to do?
    - Why would they want to do that?
    - Why would they pay money for that?
- Prospecting: Find potential customers
- Qualifying & Investigating: Test to see if our solution sticks with those potential customers
- Demonstrating: tell them about your solution to their need
- Closing: ask them if they would be interested in trying out what you have in mind when it's ready (and getting their commitment to do that).
- Build a launch list so you have a potential customer base and to guage whether or not you're going to be able to successfully _market_ your SaaS offering. If you can't get an email address, you'll never get a credit card number.

#### Finding the Right Words
Now that we have our guess, we need to answer three important questions:

1. What do I think people want to do?
1. Why would they want to do that?
1. Why would they pay money for that?

Excercise: Fill in the blank. Define the ability, outcome and value for your guess. _I believe that people want to [ability] so that they can [outcome]_, _and they would pay good money for that because [value]_.

Example:

> I believe that people want to **send automated drip email campaigns to their email list signups** so that they can **automatically nurture leads and convert them into paying customers**, and they would pay good money for that because **trying to convert leads by manually sending emails or by using something like MailChimp is hard and takes forever**.

Another way to put this is: _If you [value]_, _you can [ability] with [Your Business Name] so that you can [outcome]_. For example:

> If you **have been trying to convert leads by manually sending emails or by using something like MailChimp and think it's hard and takes forever**, you can **send automated drip email campaigns to your email list signups** with **MailZoo** so that you can **automatically nurture leads and convert them into paying customers**.

- ability: **send automated drip email campaigns to their email list signups**
- outcome: **automatically nurture leads and convert them into paying customers**
- value: **trying to convert leads by manually sending emails or by using something like MailChimp is hard and takes forever**

Are your business hypothesis and customer-facing message believable? Do you really think people would give you good money for the ability you're giving them? Is the outcome you came up with plausible and something that people actually want to acieve? If not, go back to the drawing board until it sings. This can take minutes, hours, days, weeks or even months to get right. If you never get it right, chances are your guess was wrong and you'll need to come up with a new one.

#### Prospecting: Find Potential Customers
Now our job is to find people that meet this criteria. Using the example, we're looking for people who **have been trying to convert leads by manually sending emails or by using something like MailChimp and think it's hard and takes forever**. To do this we need to discover these thing:

1. How do we find these people?
1. How do we get our message in front of these people, and in what way?
1. How do these people resond to our offering?

Think about 20 different and specific places you can find the kinds of people that would want to give you money for the value you are offering. If you think you will find them on online forums, then name the specific online forums. Note that all the forums you write down count only as one of the 20 specific places.

This is hard work. It will take a lot of time to find 20 such places. Based on the ongoing example, you might consider people following MailChimp on Twitter, people who hang out on inbound.org (an email marketing site), people who have blogs with a newsletter signup box, people listening to the Smart Passive Income podcast, people who have retweeted any of Ramit Sethi's articles, people who like HubSpot on Facebook.

If you find 20 good places, you will have a better idea who your customer is. Now we're going to find out if people care about what you have to say. The kicker is, we're not going to tell them anything about our solution. Instead, we're going to see if they care about the reason we think they'd want to give us money.

Research 10 individual people from each of the 20 places we've identified. Take the "people who have blogs with a newsletter signup box" example. Find 10 blogs that we think would give us money basedon the premise we've identified. Find out how you can get in touch with the person running the blog. Ideally, you want an email address, but a contact form will due.

Send them a personalized message, like the following:

> “Hey <Name>! I was just reading your post about <what the post's about>. I totally agree with you that <some point they made>. In fact, <your own thoughts on that point>. I also noticed that you have a newsletter. I was curious what kinds of things you send to your list, if you have products you are trying to sell to your list, and if you're doing it all by hand or using something like MailChimp for that? The reason I ask is I'm thinking of doing something with newsletters myself and I'm not too sure what people like you are doing with theirs. Anything you could share with me would be huge. Thanks and keep up the awesome work you're doing!”

Don't be deceptive. Never say you like something if you don't, express interest in something you couldn't care less about, or mislead them in any way. Stay honest, or you'll find there are consequences that will hurt you in the long run.

If you've done a good job, you'll get a few helpful responses from the 200 messages. On the internet, indifference seems to rule. If you get good responses that relate to your idea, fantastic. If you don't get any responses that reinforce your hypothesis, you have a few options:

1. Get 10 more people from the original 20 places you identified, and try again.
1. Pick 20 different ways to find people who should give good responses. Find 10 people from each of those, and repeat the exercise with them.
1. Scrap your "idea" and start over. You guessed wrong.

#### Qualitfying and Investigating: Test to see if Our Solution Sticks
Assuming you have some confirmation that people are feeling the pain point, seeking the **value** you guessed at, it's time to find out if your solution is worth anything. You can reply to their thoughtful and helpful response with something like this (**Demonstrating**):

> Thanks for getting back to me! I've actually been asking some other bloggers about their newsletters too and they're basically echoing what you're saying — that it's a little rough to do everything by hand or with MailChimp and that they're not getting the results they want. Out of curiosity, if there were something that would let you send automated drip email campaigns to your email list signups so that you could automatically nurture leads and convert them into paying customers, would that be something you'd be interested in? I only ask because after hearing everyone talking about this, I'm thinking there could be a good opportunity to do something different here. Plus I'm a developer, and I think that could be a fun project to work on :)

We use the ability and outcome from our earlier messaging exercise to test the waters. One of the following is likely to happen:

1. You don't get a response.
1. You get a response along the lines of "No, it's not that big of a problem for me."
1. You get a response along the lines of "Oh, there's a bunch of companies already doing that. I just don't use them because they cost too much."
1. You get a response along the lines of "Oh yes! I want that!"

Here's what you should do (**Closing**). If you don't get a response, follow up until you do, or until they tell you to go away.

If their response is "No, it's not a problem", ask them under what circumstances it would become a problem or make sense for them to try what you're offering. If you get enough of these types of responses, it may be that you're close, and that you just need to target people that have the problem they refer to, or are in the circumstances they describe.

If their response is "There's a bunch of companies already doing that", don't scrap your idea! Just because someone else is already doing what you thought was a revolutionary concept doesn't mean you should give up. In fact, it helps to prove that there might already be a market out there for you. In this case, you should ask them what they mean by "expensive" and what they would like to see in the market as an alternative to the companies they mentioned. See if adjusting your offering in light of these insights will get you to "Heck yes".

If they've said, "Oh yes", you're nailing it. After you get these responses, tell them that you're looking into what you can do fro them, and ask them if they'd be interested to look at what you come up with.

The goal is to get to 20 "Heck yes" responses that are interested in hearing about what you come up with. You'll need to refine your message, listen to feedback, adjust your message again, try different approaches, different places, different people, etc. If you can't get to 20, you might want to reconsider what you're doing.

### Landing Pages
You haven't built enough landing pages until you're sick of building landing pages. I'm going to have to learn a little about JavaScript, CSS, Web Design and a few other things to build landing pages.

Clifford Oravec, the author of [The Epic Guide to Bootstrapping a SaaS Startup from Scratch - By Yourself](https://medium.com/@cliffordoravec/the-no-bs-approach-to-building-your-saas-startups-launch-list-part-2-of-the-epic-guide-to-8cc371be772c#.e5m2bz5ds) claims that building the actual landing page is the easiest part of this process. You can use services like Leadpages to build one out or you can roll your own (if you're so inclined).

Your landing page needs to do the following:

- Collect an email address and save it in a database somewher
- Incorporate elements from your messaging (the one that got you your 20 "Heck Yeses"). Specifically, it needs to articulate (in any order):
    - Who is this for?
    - What does it do?
    - Why should they give you money for it?
- Incorporate some kind of promise. What are you promising (explicitly or implicitly) that people will get if they decide to use your service? Make sure this is clear.

Don't create a page that looks _exactly_ like a finished marketing site, complete with screenshots, etc. and that you should "trick" people int signing up for your service to test if they'd pay for the finished product. You'll just piss off potential customers.

Be honest and read [Ian Landsman](https://medium.com/u/cf9306b0c352)'s article [Shady Tactics in our Midst](https://ianlandsman.com/2016/11/14/shady-tactics-in-our-midst/), which is about this topic.

What you _do_ put on your landing page is **one** and **only one** feature or aspect of your potential solution, and you're going to put together a page with the messaging you've tested for your solution. That one feature or aspect should be the _main_ thing you think people would pay money for, and should be the _one_ feature you would build out for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

Assume that it would take you one year to build your whole solution. Just assume that. You need to pick the one feature you would start with that you could build in a month that people would be willing to give you money for. Yes, one month. And yes, give you money. That's the thing we're going to talk about on our landing page. Nothing else. Any other features, no matter how great, can be written into a design notebook or scheduled on a Kanban board, but they do **not** go on the landing page.

**No screenshots**. **No mockups**. **Just text**. Right now, we want to test if our messaging is something that the market responds to, and if it can stand on its own. Product screenshots are to developers and techies, like catnip to a cat. You will attract the _wrong_ type of attention if you use them at this phase.

Here's Tamboos first landing page as an example:

<img srcset="/assets/Startups/TamboosFirstLandingPage.png 880w"
     sizes="(min-width: 1745px) 650px, 37vw"
     alt="Example: Tamboo's First Landing Page"
     crossorigin="anonymous">

After some experimentation, he distilled the essence and narrowed in on the message:

<img srcset="/assets/Startups/TamboosImprovedLandingPage.png 1100w"
     sizes="(min-width: 1745px) 650px, 37vw"
     alt="Example: Tamboo's Improved Landing Page"
     crossorigin="anonymous">

The beauty of this approach is he didn't have to figure out what the app should look like, and people still signed up, validating the concept and more importantly, validating the marketing messaging.

He also uses this tactic when he wants to test out if he should build new features. When people client the "Request an Invite" button, you add them to your email list (just a table in a database) along with the HTTP referrer that sent them (so you know where signups come from), thank them, and then ideally ask them to take some other action to help you out. For example, invite them to become an existing customer of the main product:

<img srcset="/assets/Startups/TamboosFeatureThankYou.png 880w"
     sizes="(min-width: 1745px) 650px, 37vw"
     alt="Example: Tamboo's Feature Thank You page"
     crossorigin="anonymous">
