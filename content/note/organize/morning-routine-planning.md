According to [this article](http://www.bakadesuyo.com/2015/03/morning-routine/) by [Eric Barker](http://www.bakadesuyo.com/about/) (and various [books by Laura Vanderkam](http://www.amazon.com/Laura-Vanderkam/e/B001JRX55A/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1) ), one of the best ways to get things done is to have a morning routine. In addition to a routine you need a plan, so here is Barker's advice to build a roadmap for getting things done and having *real* free time.

## Detailed To-Do Lists for Everyday Tasks
I read about these in some comments on HN about a completely different topic. Some people create detailed to-do lists for basic tasks to eliminate analysis-paralysis. Here's one person's task list for cleaning house:

Task: 'Clean the house'

1. Grab big garbage bag
1. Go from room to room and put garbage in bag.
1. Put garbage bag in outside bin.
1. Grab large basket.
1. First room: put items that do not belong in room into the basket.
1. Subsequent rooms: Items in basket that belong -> dump somewhere in room. Items that don't belong in room -> in the basket.

For some, even this task is too big. Here's a smaller example:

Living room:

- Remove garbage
- Put dirty dishes in kitchen
- Put stuff that doesn't belong in tote
- Put everything that does belong on shelves
- Vacuum

## Stop Reacting
Get up before the insanity starts. Don't check your email or anything else that is going to dictate your behavior. Keep the first 90 to 150 minutes of your day for yourself.

## Decide the 3 Things that Matter Today
There are two types of work, Shallow and Deep. The Shallow work is little stuff like email, meetings, moving information around. Things that are not really using your talents. Deep work pushes your current abilities to their limits. It produces high value results and improves your skills.

- Shallow work prevents you from getting fired.
- Deep work is what gets you promoted! Deep work must get priority.

Ask yourself what really creates progress vs. treading water? What gives disproportionate results? Do those things.

Don't be vague, either. Specify what you need to get done. Research shows having concrete goals is correlated with huge increases in confidence and feelings of control.

### Schedule Everything
By and of themselves, to-do lists are useless. They're just the first step to getting things done. You have to assign them time on your schedule. It makes you be realistic about what you can get done. It allows you to do tasks when it's efficient, not just because it's No. 4. *Until it's on your calendar and assigned an hour, it's just a list of wishful thinking*.

According to [Cal Newport](http://calnewport.com/blog/),

> Scheduling forces you to confront the reality of how much time you actually have and how long things will take. Now that you look at the whole picture you’re able to get something productive out of every free hour you have in your workday. You not only squeeze more work in but you’re able to put work into places where you can do it best.

Also, assigning work to times reduces the urge to procrastinate. You are no longer deciding whether or not to work during a given period; the decision is already made.

### Plan Your Day Backward
Assume you're going home at 5:30, then plan your day backward. By setting a deadline of 5:30 and then scheduling tasks you can get control over the plethora of needful things coming your way.

Fix your ideal schedule, then work backward to make everything fit - ruthlessly cull obligations, turning people down, become hard to reach, and shed marginally useful tasks along the way. Making a fixed schedule a reality forces a number of really smart and useful in-the-moment productivity decisions.

### Make a Plan for the Entire Week
Cal Newport says he knows each week what he's doing with each day of the week and he knows each month what he's doing with each week of the month. Every Monday he lays out a [plan for the week](http://calnewport.com/blog/2014/08/08/deep-habits-plan-your-week-in-advance/). He goes through his inbox, his task list, and his calendar, and tries to come away with the best thing to do with each day this week. He then writes it in an email and sends it to himself. He leaves it in his inbox, because that's a place he knows he will see it every day, and he will be reminded of it multiple times throughout the day.

### Do Very Few Things, but Be Awesome at Them
If you find you have too many things to do in a day, don't work until late at night. Instead, do fewer things. Not everything is essential. Ask "What's creating real value in my life?" and then eliminate as much of the rest as you can.

Cal Newport says:

> You’re judged on what you do best so if you want to have as much success as possible you’re always better off doing fewer things but doing those things better. People say yes to too much. I say no to most things. I’m ruthless about avoiding or purging tasks if I realize they’re just not providing much value.

### Less Shallow Work, Focus on the Deep Stuff
Give yourself big blocks of uninterrupted time to make things of value.

Per Cal:

> People who are the most busy often are getting a lot less done of significance than the people who are able to stop by 5PM every day. That’s because the whole reason they need to work at night and on the weekends is because their work life has become full of just shallows. They’re responding to messages, moving information around and being a human network router. These things are very time consuming and very low value.

One step to avoid "drowning in the shallows" is to wait until after the first hour or two of the morning before you check email. You might need to check email to finish all of your most important items on your to-do list, but you can get the vast majority done beforehand. By waiting an hour or two, you get a big block of time to focus on the important stuff and avoid that time consuming process of separating the good stuff from the noise.

## Use Your Best Hours for Your 3 Goals
Generally, you have 2 to 2.5, and maybe as many as 4, hours of peak productivity every day. Don't waste them in meetings or shuffling around information. For many people, these hours are early in the day - around 2.5 to 4 hours after waking up is when your brain is sharpest. If you're a night owl, then use those hours for your key tasks.

In the afternoon when your energy tends to dip, use that time to do a mini-version of your [morning ritual](#morning-ritual). Review your goals and the progress you made that morning. Taking a little time to think about the progress you've made, to appreciate how far you've come, and realize you can do these tasks will motivate you to continue making progress in the afternoon.

## <a name="morning-ritual">Have a Morning Ritual</a>
Charles Duhigg, the author of "The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business," says:

> One way to use habits to fight procrastination is to develop a habitualized response to starting. When people talk about procrastination, what they’re usually actually talking about is the first step. In general, if people can habitualize that first step, it makes it a lot easier.

Perhaps getting a cup of coffee, or going to a location where you're usually productive is the trigger to get you into a productive mood and mode.

Per Wendy Wood, a professor at USC:

> Habits emerge from the gradual learning of associations between an action and outcome, and the contexts that have been associated with them. Once the habit is formed, various elements from the context can serve as a cue to activate the behavior, independent of intention and absent of a particular goal... Very often, the conscious mind never gets engaged.

## Use Positive Procrastination
Some days it's difficult to start on the first task. What's needed to keep yourself productive and avoid really procrastinating is a more methodical way of writing down your commitments in your to-do list.

Make the first task or two on your list a really daunting, nearly impossible, tasks that sound important, but really isn't. Also, choose tasks that *seem* to have deadlines, but really don't. Farther down the list, include some tasks that you can do and really matter.

What happens is you can tell yourself it's okay to avoid the first task or two, as long as your doing one of the next few items.

## Create Success Lists
The notes in this section are from the article [Why Your To-Do List is Broken and How You Can Fix It](https://zapier.com/blog/to-do-list-broken/).

A success list is a list of thoughtfully chosen tasks that maximize on'e time and energy, based on the values and goals that matter most to that person.

Consider the concept of productivity as the tip of an iceberg (producivity, with profit at the very peak). This is a concept from the book "The ONE Thing". It's what most of us see, so it's how we judge success. Productivity often looks like getting a lot of things done, but it doesn't highlight how to get the right things done, nor how to choose the right things to do. Those are the parts of the iceberg that are under the water, and are called **purpose** (the very deepest part of the iceberg) and **priority**.

Purpose is about having a clear sense of what drives you. Priority is about knowing what you need to focus on to help you achieve your deepest purpose. It's difficult to prioritize your list of to-dos if you haven't taken time to thing about what matters to you most.

### 1. Write Down What Matters to You
How are you spending your time right now? Why are you spending your time that way?

Ask yourself these questions:

- Why do you do what you do?
- What would you do even if you didn't get paid to do it?
- What are you deeply passionate about?
- What do you hope you'll be able to say you accomplished 50 years from now?
- What is the single most important thing in your life?

Answers to these questions cause anxiety, so they can be difficult to answer. However, you don't have to search far beyond yourself. To find clues about what you value, think about:

- what you loved doing as a kid.
- how you choose to spend your free time now.
- what you talk about the most in conversations with the people closest to you.

#### 28 Questions to Help Find Your Passion
These might help you focus on what's really important to you.

1. What makes you happiest in your life? What excites you?
2. What do you do that makes you feel invincible?
3. What do people thank you for?
4. What are you ridiculously good at?
5. Who do you look up to? Who are your mentors? Who inspires you? Why?
6. When was the last time you massively over-delivered on something? What was it and why did you work so damn hard?
7. When was the last time you were in a state of flow, in the zone and totally lost track of time? What were you doing?
8. Imagine you won $158 million in the lottery. It's not three months later. How will you spend tomorrow?
9. What would you do if you know you could not fail?
10. If you could have or do anything, what would it be?
11. What topics do you find yourself continuously arguing or defending with others? What beliefs does your stance represent?
12. What makes you most angry about the state of the world? With unlimited resources how could you fix it?
13. What are you most afraid of for the next generation, whether or not you have kids?

19. If you were able to be a member of the audience at your own funeral (in 100 years or so), what would you want to hear people say?
20. What do you want to be remembered for - what dent do you want to have put in the world?
21. What do your friends always tell you you'd be good at, that you should do for a living (i.e. "he'd make a great...")? If you don't remember, then go ask five of them.
22. What are you naturally curious about?
23. If you had a free hour to surf the internet, what would you explore?
24. Think back to when you were 5 or 10 years old. What did you want to be when you grew up? Anything goes. What skills and mataphors do these represent (i.e., pilot may be a symbol for freedom).
25. If you could write a book to help the world, that is guaranteed to be a best seller, what would the title be? What's it about?
26. What careers do you find yourself dreaming of? What jobs do others have that you wish were yours?
27. What 3-5 dream jobs or businesses can you imagine that would firmly embody your core beliefs about the world? The sky's the limit.
28. What revolution do you want to lead?

#### Reflect
The goal here is to create a list of your the top 25 things you want to do in the next few years, or even the rest of your life.

Take a full day to reflect on and write down your answers to these questions. Try Warren Buffet's [five-step process for true success](http://liveyourlegend.net/warren-buffetts-5-step-process-for-prioritizing-true-success-and-why-most-people-never-do-it/)

1. Know what you want. List the top 25 things you want to do in the next few years (or even in your lifetime). Just jot down anything that comes to mind as being important to you that isn't currently a part of your life.
2. Pick your top 5. Review your list and circle the five that are most important. Take some time; it will not likely be easy. Here are some steps to take that will help you figure it out:
    1. Look at the first goal listed. Put a "one" next to it. Compare the first with the second. If the first one is more important than the second, move on to the third and compare that to the first. Keep going through the list until you find one that's more important than the first. If you don't find one, then the first is your No. 1 priority.
    2. Once you find one that's more important, cross out the "one" next to the first and put a "one" next to the goal that's more important.
    3. Continue down the list comparing each goal with your new No. 1. Go to the end of the list and start again from the beginning until you have compared every other goal to your new No. 1.
    4. Once you've compared one goal to everything on the list, and it's still No. 1, you have found your top priority. Circle it.
    5. Repeat the steps above to find the goals that are your second through fifth priority.
    6. If you want, you can repeat for the remaining 20 goals.
    7. List your top 4 in order.
    8. Make a Goal Setting and Action Workbook
    9. The 20 goals that are not in your top 5 are your "Avoid at all cost list."
3. Make your Top 5 Plan. Figure out how you're going to achieve these. Get started right away.
4. Marry your priorities. Do not spend any time on the other 20 until you've achieved your top five!
5. Know your 'Avoid at all Cost List' and stick to it. I think, the remaining 20 goals become this list, if I understood [the article](http://liveyourlegend.net/warren-buffetts-5-step-process-for-prioritizing-true-success-and-why-most-people-never-do-it/) correctly.

The point of step 5 is that if you have too many distractions, you'll never get anything done.

#### You Cannot Be a Superstar if You Focus on Everything
We are in a world where there is more competition for our time and focus than ever before. We have to guard it with our life, because it *is* our life. Without focus, without staying true to our priorities, not only will we not get done the extra things we try to fit in, but we won't get done what's most important to our core - the things that create fulfillment, excitement and happiness.

Stay focused on your core and other opportunities may follow as you become more seasoned. First and foremost, it's important to stay focused.

Take inventory of where you spend your time. You'll have an idea of what kind of projects you already have. The more you have to choose, the more time you spend deliberatting over what to do next, which is more time spent *not* doing one of the things most important to you. It's the paradox of choice. The more options you have, the less likely you are to choose any of them.

- Take seriously what you care about most and avoid everything else like the plague.
- Decide what important things you are *not* going to do right now.
- Do that and make room for the real game changers.
- Know what you want and go get it.

### 2. Track Your Time
The author suggests tracking it in 20 minute intervals for the next seven days. You can use a worksheet that lists:

- Things I Must Do Today (leave room for 5 items)
- Today, I Must Contact: (leave room for 5 items)
- Notes (make a narrow column for notes)
- Make a wide column for hours of the day, starting when you get up until you go to bed. Make room for two lines of text per hour. I get up at 5am and go to bed at 10pm, so I will need 34 lines available to write down what I did each hour. That should be more than enough to clock in a note for 20 minute intervals.

### 3. Figure Out Your Priorities
Once you have a week's worth of data on how you spend your time, categorize your tasks. Here's a list of sample categories to get you started:

- Social media
- Checking work email
- Checking personal email
- Writing content
- Strategic planning
- Meetings
- Relaxation time
- Spending time with your family
- Sleeping
- Exercise
- Hobbies
- Cooking, meal preparation
- Cleaning
- Eating meals
- Socializing in the **real world**, that is, spending time with friends in the **real world**.
- Job search
- Professional development

Next, calculate the percentage of time you spend on each activity. There are 168 hours in a week, so divide the amount of time you spend on each activity category by 168.

Compare this time grid to your list of values and purpose-driven goals (when did I create my list of values and goals?). If you say family is the most important thing to you, but you're spending 70 percent of your waking hours on work, you know your priorities are out of balance.

Note: There are 168 hours in a week. If you average 8 hours of sleep a night, then there are 112 *waking hours* in a week. If you work 40 hours per week, then you are spending about 36 percent of your *waking hours* at work. You also might be spending 5 to 10 hours per week commuting between home and work. That leaves only 67 - 72 waking hours for everything else. That's 60 - 64 percent of your *waking hours* for everything else. Interesting. That doesn't seem like a lot of time each week.

I tend to get 7 hours of sleep per night on average. That leaves 119 hours. If I work 40 hours a week (which is nearly 38 percent of my waking hours), and I commute one hour per day, 5 days per week, I get 74 hours per week, or 62 percent of my waking hours for everything else. That's a little better in absolute hours, but about the same in terms of percentage of waking hours. It's probably as close to ideal as I can get with a 40 hour work week.

Finally, determine how you'd like to re-distribute your time in the future. What can you spend less time on? What do you want to spend more time on? Make a list of changes you want to make to how you spend your time, based on your life's purpose and what you most want to accomplish in the next 3-5 years (which should, ultimately, tie back to what you want to accomplish in the next 50 years).

### 4. Create a Success List

## Goal Setting and Action Workbook
1. Reflect on what made last year awesome, or not so awesome.
2. Define your areas of attention. List the core areas of your life where you want to get results.
3. Define resolutions and habbits. These are general themes of improvement or change you want to work on.
4. Create a core goal in each area of attention.
5. Get specific. Define what you really want. Make these specific goals quantifiable and measurable.
6. Get leverage. Find a compelling and emotional reason why. Positive or negative, discover what will make it an absolute must to accomplish your goal.
7. Fill in the details. Create baby steps.
8. Get them on a calendar. This harkens back to "Schedule Everything."
9. Get accountable. Tell at least 4 people about them.
10. Routinely review your progress, weekly and monthly. See your (morning-routine-planning-schedule-roadmap.md) notes.
11. Do something now, no matter how small.
