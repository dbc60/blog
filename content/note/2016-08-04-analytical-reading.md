## The Rules of the Road
There are four rules to analytical reading. First, classify the book according to its kind and subject matter. Next, state what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity. Third, enumerate its major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts as you have outlined the whole. Finally, define the problem or problems the author is trying to solve.
