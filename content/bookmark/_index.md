The web used to be about links between sites so you could travel down rabbit holes of ideas and information. It still is to some extent. Some people happily publish links to other sites within their articles. There are a lot of these sites, but some (maybe most) of the small ones can be hard to find.

The [Small Website Discoverability Crisis](https://www.marginalia.nu/log/19-website-discoverability-crisis/) has a simple, but brilliant way to solve that problem. Create a list of bookmarks linking to websites you find interesting, and publish it for the world to see. You decide what constitutes "interesting".

The author of that article published their own page of [bookmarks](https://www.marginalia.nu/links/bookmarks/). I want to do the same, so here are a few links to start with to sites I like:

- Table Top Role-Playing Games
    - [M. T. Black](https://www.mtblackgames.com/) sends out an interesting weekly newsletter about table-top role-playing games (TTRPGs). [His blog](https://www.mtblackgames.com/blog) is pretty good, too.
    - [Wyrmworks Publishing](https://wyrmworkspublishing.com/) is the home of [Limitless Heroics](https://wyrmworkspublishing.com/product/limitless-heroics/), a large book containing sets of fantasy characters with disabilities, mental illness, and neurodivergence compatible with Dungeons & Dragons, Fifth Edition.
- Animation
    - [Ian Hubert's YouTube site](https://www.youtube.com/@IanHubert2/videos). He does a lot of work in animation and teaches some aspects of using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to create 3D digital assets.
- Web and Computer Technologies
    - [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/) is an open-source Content Management System (CMS) that could be part of your [JAMstack] if you're into such things.
    - [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast static-site generator that is part of my [JAMStack].
    - [Sol√®ne Rapenne's blog](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/). She is very much about topics related to [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/), Lisp, computer hardware, and similar things.
    - [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/home.html) is the blog and notes of a couple, Devine Lu Linvega and Rekka Bellum, who live on a sailboat.
- Miscellaneous
    - [Old occupation names](https://rmhh.co.uk/occup/).
