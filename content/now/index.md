title: What I'm Doing Now

October 1st, 2021 [F5 Networks](https://f5.com) acquired [Threat Stack](https://www.threatstack.com/)! F5 did not layoff anyone from Threat Stack, so everyone had a choice to say or move on to other opportunities. I chose to stay, and am still working on the Threat Stack agents. The headquarters are in Seattle, WA, but we still have an office in Boston, MA. Like Threat Stack, F5 has a generous work-from-home policy of which I'm taking full advantage. I do NOT miss commuting an hour and a half each way between home and the Boston office.

I am the primary developer of the Windows Agent, and am a significant contributor to the Linux, containerized, and Fargate agents. Threat Stack was a great place to work, and so far F5 is equally as good. Everyone F5'er I've met to date (today is Monday, October 18, 2021) has been very welcoming and a pleasure to chat with.

I am also a frustrated game-designer wannabee. Game design looks like fun, but it is difficult to find time to pursue it.
