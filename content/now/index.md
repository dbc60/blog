The economy is getting tough. [F5, Inc.][F5] laid off about 9% of their workforce, or 623 employees, worldwide. I was surprised to see so many good engineers, product managers, sales people, and others go. It's time to figure out what comes next.

F5 acquired Threat Stack October 1st, 2021. At the time I worked in the Application Infrastructure Protection (AIP) division doing pretty much what I was before, adding features to the Windows, Linux, containerized, and Fargate agents.
