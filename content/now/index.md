October 1st, 2021 [F5 Networks](https://f5.com) acquired [Threat Stack](https://www.threatstack.com/)! As far as I know, F5 did not layoff anyone from Threat Stack. They treated the acquistion like they were hiring individuals and made separate offers that each person could choose to accept or not. I think most were given offers for permanent positions, while others were offered temporary positions to help with the transition. I chose to stay, and am still working on the (formerly Threat Stack) agents. I am the primary developer of the Windows Agent, and am a significant contributor to the Linux, containerized, and Fargate agents.

Threat Stack was a great place to work, and so far F5 is equally as good. Every F5'er I've met to date (today is Friday, September 30, 2022) has been very welcoming and a pleasure to chat with. Like Threat Stack, F5 has a generous work-from-home policy of which I'm taking full advantage. I do NOT miss commuting an hour and a half each way between home and the Boston office.
