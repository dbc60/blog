As of June 2023, I work for [PreVeil](https://www.preveil.com/), provider of simple, encrypted email and file collaboration software. In my free time, I tend to a bunch of little projects.
<!--more-->

- I'm building a [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-core/) storage server to see if I can make it both a local backup server and a [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) or [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) media server.
- I'm looking into building a couple of [rain gardens](https://www.epa.gov/soakuptherain/soak-rain-rain-gardens) next spring, one in the front yard and one in the back. Rain gardens have a lot of environmental benefits, but that's not the _real_ purpose. I want something pretty that will guide water away from the house and cut down on the amount of lawn I have to mow.
- Attempting to play Baldur's Gate 3 with my cousin who lives three timezones away. BG3 hasn't been stable on his MacBook Air, but [Larian Studios](https://larian.com/) is working on it. We'll have our play dates soon.
- Enjoying pictures of my grandson on a [digital picture frame](https://auraframes.com/) that my daughter and son-in-law quite regularly update.
- Blog maintenance.
  - Fixed how "alt text" is applied to images that I accidentally screwed up.
  - Added some more metadata based on the [Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/):
    - `<meta property="og:locale" content="en_US" />`
    - `<meta property="og:site_name" content="Douglas Cuthbertson" />`
  - Updated [Hugo] to version 0.120.4.
  - Started a page of links, [Bookmarks]({{< ref "bookmark" >}}), to websites I find interesting, but may be located in some small corner of the Internet.

This page is inspired by Derek Siver's [/now page movement](https://sivers.org/nowff). You can see [lots of sites](http://nownownow.com/) which have `/now` pages.
