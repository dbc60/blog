/* This is completely ridiculous. To get drop-caps on markdown files, I've
   copied the drop-caps CSS from gwern.net. It uses 'id="markdownBody"'
   as the selector. That fails miserably for reStructuredText files,
   because the rst2HTML5 conversion wraps the main portion of any post or
   note in a '<div class="document"></div>.

   My quick workaround is to copy all of the drop-caps CSS and replace
   #markdownBody with .document. I hope this will be a temporary situation.
   I'd really like to simplify this mess.
