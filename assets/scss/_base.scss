 Fix jumping scrollbar. Taken from
 https://css-tricks.com/elegant-fix-jumping-scrollbar-issue/

 The text is:
  If you move from one page of a site without a scrollbar to another with a scrollbar,
  you'll see a slight layout shift as things squeeze inward a bit to make room for the
  scrollbar.

  A classic fix was html { overflow-y: scroll; } to force the scrollbar all the time.
  Ayke van LaÃ«them has found a more elegant solution in html { margin-left: calc(100vw
  - 100%); } which works because vw accounts for the scrollbar and % doesn't, and...
  just read it as there are a few more things you'll need to be aware of anyway.

 More details are at: https://aykevl.nl/2014/09/fix-jumping-scrollbar
