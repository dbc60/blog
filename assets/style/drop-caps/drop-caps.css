/* DROP CAPS */
/*************/
/*  "drop caps"/"initials" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial
    https://wiki.obormot.net/Reference/DropCapsDemo) are large fancy
    block letters used to start a page/section. We skip them on mobile because
    they use up 8-12KB each (even after @font-face subset optimization to load
    only 1 letter at a time), and take up a lot of screen space.
    (Mobile users can't have nice things.) To implement them, each Markdown
    page has a custom metadata field like "css: drop-caps_de-zs" which is
    substituted into the compiled HTML like
    '<body class="pagename drop-caps_de-zs">', allowing defining of multiple
    drop-caps and customized per page. The 3 drop-caps right now are Goudy
    ('drop-caps_de-zs'), yinit ('drop-caps_yinit'), and
    De-Zs/Deutsche Zierschrift ('drop-caps_de-zs'). Goudy is for
    literary/historical/humanities pages, yinit is for technical/scientific
    pages, and De-Zs is for everything else.
